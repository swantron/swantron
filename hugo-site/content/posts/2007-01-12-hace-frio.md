Enjoy this snapshot of my Chevy's rear view mirror. ![frio.jpg](/uploads/2007/01/frio.jpg)This is just plain ridiculous. This SS saw 114 degrees in the South Dakota badlands last June on the way back from Greg's Omaha wedding. That makes for a 129 degree operating range at least. Impressive...like Grif's package.
