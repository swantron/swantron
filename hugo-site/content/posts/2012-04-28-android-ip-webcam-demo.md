Poking around on the Android Market for an app to control my Foscam IP Webcams, I stumbled across a cool app concept. Long story short, someone wrote some code to serve the live camera feed...effectively turning an android device into an IP cam. \[caption id="attachment\_4533" align="alignnone" width="1000" caption="web cam-y"\][![android demo ip webcam](/uploads/2012/04/android-ip-webcam.jpg "android-ip-webcam")](https://swantron.com/android-ip-webcam-demo/android-ip-webcam/)\[/caption\] The app is free on the Market...just search for IP Webcam and it will pop up. Here it is in operation, serving from my Droid 2 for viewing on my Linux machine... <iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="416" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/7eWRyWInlB4" width="569"></iframe>This would pair nicely with my IOIO project, provided I can bring it back from the grave. I could mount the phone itself on the payload, giving this sucker on-board video. A second device (Galaxy...) could provide the board control, and I could implement a web view into my app. Might be on to something here...stay tuned.
