It showed up... ![woot b o c](/uploads/2011/05/woot-bocrap.jpg "woot-bocrap") I got excited and made an un-boxing vid. Apparently, I get twitchy when I am excited. Probably why I interview like shit. Anyhow... <iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="349" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/MpomhE6dgww" width="425"></iframe>So, my three dollar (eight with shipping) bag of crap yielded: \* Passive laptop cooling pad \* Refurbished DSL router \* Strawberry that unfolds into a bag? \* Remote controlled Batman helicopter \* Three dog brushes Not bad at all; I'm chalking this up as a win.
