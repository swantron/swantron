I cleaned up the UI, and added some README details. You can snag the app or update on the Android Market (search for IOIO) \[caption id="attachment\_3968" align="aligncenter" width="480" caption="50 + ???"\][![market android app](/uploads/2011/10/android-dev.png "android-dev")](/uploads/2011/10/android-dev.png)\[/caption\] Pop over to the [Android Market](https://market.android.com/details?id=swantron.project.seek&feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsInN3YW50cm9uLnByb2plY3Quc2VlayJd) and give a review if you have it going v \[caption id="attachment\_3969" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="2.1"\][![swantron on android market ioio](/uploads/2011/10/ioioseekmarket-570x356.png "ioioseekmarket")](/uploads/2011/10/ioioseekmarket.png)\[/caption\] As the commits hint, I have pushed my code out to [my GitHub page](https://github.com/swantron/IOIO-Seek). Fork that thing. Stay tuned for the next project...I just need to find some time to smash together the hardware and we'll be good to go.
