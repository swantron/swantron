Just hanging out. Committing a little Java. ![pushing to master ioio android code](/uploads/2011/10/push-to-master.png "push-to-master") Introducing IOIOSeek v2.1. ![new android ioio app](/uploads/2011/10/ioiostuff.png "ioiostuff") In preparation for my next project, I have beefed up my app to support four simultaneous servos, three real-time analog readings, and two binary digital outputs. I cleaned up the UI, and added some README details. You can snag the app or update on the Android Market (search for IOIO) ![market android app](/uploads/2011/10/android-dev.png "android-dev") Pop over to the [Android Market](https://market.android.com/details?id=swantron.project.seek&feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsInN3YW50cm9uLnByb2plY3Quc2VlayJd) and give a review if you have it going v ![swantron on android market ioio](/uploads/2011/10/ioioseekmarket-570x356.png "ioioseekmarket") As the commits hint, I have pushed my code out to [my GitHub page](https://github.com/swantron/IOIO-Seek). Fork that thing. Stay tuned for the next project...I just need to find some time to smash together the hardware and we'll be good to go.
