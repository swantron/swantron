Is holidaytree the PC term? Dave is selling trees this year, which found Chuck Chisslah and I tramping around the Bridger Mountains looking for a few gems. It turns out that the Baxter Hotel required a "fuller" tree than Southwest MT could provide...if anyone would like to purchase an eighteen footer give Morrison a ring. Also, if anyone wants to buy Morrison a better goddamn chainsaw feel free to do so. I may or may not have thrown this hunk of shit somewhere between three and two dozen times this summer while building various stair features across our picturesque valley. ![chainsaw.jpg](/uploads/2006/12/chainsaw.jpg)Here is a pic of said valley heading south from the mountains. Not a very good one at that. ![tree.jpg](/uploads/2006/12/tree.jpg)
