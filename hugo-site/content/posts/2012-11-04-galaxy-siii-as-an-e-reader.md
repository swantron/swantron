Maybe the most pleasingly unexpected aspect of the Samsung Galaxy S3 is it's e-reader usefulness. I have a tablet collecting dust...the size / resolution of the S3 screen knocks it out of the park. The iPhone 5 is a pretty nice piece of hardware, but that screen is a joke compared to the Galaxy. Take a look at the phone if you have not...best piece on the market hands down. Even more pleasing than the e-reader function is the fact that I am done e-reading this boring piece of shit... ![ulysses sucks](/uploads/2012/11/ulysses.jpg "ulysses") Scratch that off the old to-do list. Stab five at this thing was finally a success, with the four previous (print form) attempts failing after a short bit. I finally 'get' the book, but really think the thing is overrated. Whatever...on to something new. Go Samsung.
