[![useless](/uploads/2010/01/toaster.bmp "toaster")](/uploads/2010/01/toaster.bmp)I hate toasters. Why this ill-conceived piece of shit has become a staple in the American kitchen and/or kitchenette is beyond me. Toasters render bread sharp and dangerous to the mouth. Tosters re-cook cooked bread. Toasters make bread taste stale. Toasters serve the same purpose as the oven broiler, but only for bread. Toasters serve the same purpose as a George Foreman grill, but only for bread. And lastly... Toasters look like Honda Elements. v \[caption id="attachment\_1540" align="aligncenter" width="469" caption="meep meep"\][![meep meep](/uploads/2010/01/toaster-car.jpg "toaster-car")](/uploads/2010/01/toaster-car.jpg)\[/caption\]
