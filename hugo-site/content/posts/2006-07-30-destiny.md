I think I am definitely bound to wind up on Cops. Is that show still on? Anyhow, for the second Sunday in a row I ended up getting pulled over while shirtless. This week ended up better than last, resulting in a measly point-free speeding ticket. I would take that over another trip downtown any day. Or week. Since I am mostly sure nobody checks bb anymore, Kyle included, here is a poorly rendered pic for my viewing pleasure. ![joeodd.JPG](/uploads/2006/07/joeodd.JPG)
