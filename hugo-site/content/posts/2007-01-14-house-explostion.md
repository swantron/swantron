Breaking this story... ![boom.jpg](/uploads/2007/01/boom.jpg)This is a cell phone pic taken by my buddy Bailly from the Smith's parking lot forty minutes ago. Low resolution, but you can see how big that fireball is. He was trying to take a picture of the flames, and happened to get some Beirut footage. Take that Chronicle.
