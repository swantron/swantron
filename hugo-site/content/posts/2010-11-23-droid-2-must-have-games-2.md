Games kick ass, am I right? Am I right? (\*\*\*\*Spoiler...YES!\*\*\*\*\*) Since I haven't blathered about how awesome Android stuff is in a while, I figured I would ramble about games for a while. So far, I have found four games that are pretty much "must-have." I hate that term, but it gets me search engine traffic. And traffic is a must-have. (Sorry.) You can find these must-havers on Android Market, but you probably knew that. Let's begin. In order of most-must-have, to still-must-have-but-not-as-much-as-most-must-have... **Angry Birds** -- Q. Why so angry, birds? A. Those egg-stealing pigs, that's why. ![mofo](/uploads/2010/11/angry-bird.jpg "angry bird") **Robo Defense** -- Tower defense, FTW. I got really, really sucked into this one, keeping it in the two spot. All acheivements, check. ![joke fail](/uploads/2010/11/robo_defense.jpg "robo_defense") **Fruit Ninja** -- Chopping the shit out of fruit...this game is as fun as it sounds ![nacho ninja](/uploads/2010/11/fruit_ninja.jpg "fruit_ninja") **Doodle Jump** -- Pretty sure this (like Angry Birds) made some waves on iStuff. You jump a doodle...it is amusing as hell. ![stupid flanders](/uploads/2010/11/doodle.jpg "doodle") I'm still waiting for the non-advertisment-laden version of Angry Birds to drop. Right now, the free app is all that is out there on the Android Market. I'm not entirely sure, but I think I spent less than 3 bucks for the other three apps. Robo Defense has a pretty solid trial version, FWIW. Well, in any regards, *get Angry Birds*. Meetings at work become little workday vay-kays. Little bird flinging vay-kays. If you come across anything that I should check out, hit me with a comment. Or, Tweet that crap over to @swantron. Plug.
