Okay...one more obscure post before Grif and I tear it up. So my boss and I are waiting in line at Boondoggles (gas station sandwich shop...I love grinders, subs, dagwoods, whatever) when I spot a real dude wearing the same shoes as I. This may be commonplace for some bouncerblog.com readers; this is a first for me. See, I have for the past two odd years been purchasing disposable footwear in the form of \*-Mart velcro shoes. Under five dollers per unit and surprisingly comfortable. Example: ![](http://www.swantron.com/wp-content/photo_0047.jpg)![](http://www.swantron.com/wp-content/photo_0048.jpg)I also name my velcs...I christened this particular model the Buzzer Beaters. Past pairs incluce the Game Times, Triple Doubles, and Ally-oops.
