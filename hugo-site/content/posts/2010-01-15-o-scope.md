Not sure how many physicists troll around craigslist, but if they do... ![0-scope](/uploads/2010/01/o-scope.bmp "o-scope")Hands down, the best description on a craigslist item EVER FWIW, An oscilloscope measures two things: voltage and time. A charged beam of electrons "sweeps" the screen in a given time in the x-axis, and is deflected by a signal in the y-axis. The deflection from the standard signal in the trace can gauge the input signal's voltage and duration/frequency. And yes, the poster was correct. O-scopes are great.
