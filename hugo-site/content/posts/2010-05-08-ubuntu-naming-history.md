I started thinking about my first Ubuntu experience...8.04, Hardy Heron. Good stuff. I got curious and looked up the previous version names...and found them fairly interesting. ![ubuntu FTW](/uploads/2010/01/ubuntuwhite.jpg "ubuntuwhite") Warty Warthog 4.10 Hoary Hedgehog 5.04 Breezy Badger 5.10 Dapper Drake 6.06 Edgy Eft 6.10 Feisty Fawn 7.04 Gutsy Gibbon 7.10 Hardy Heron 8.04 Intrepid Ibex 8.10 Jaunty Jackalope 9.04 Karmic Koala 9.10 Lucid Lynx 10.04 Maverick Meerkat 10.10 The trend is self-apparent. Now, the names are alphabetically similar, and in a descending order. Shitty sentence, yes, but too is this sentence shitty. The numbers correspond to the year of release, and month of release...meaning that the Meerkat drop that I have will remain beta for another 5 months. Nerd points.
