Here's to the weekend. It is too nasty to sit outside, my lawn is mowed, the rivers are all blown-out (fish aren't biting) still, the Cubs aren't on for another two hours, and the Croc-Pot is full already. It looks like it is time to do some more insurance research. Nice little Sunday, actually. At work we have an opt-out for our health insurance plan. It was not worth opting out, per se, when I started there. Out of curiosity, I decided to troll around to see if health plans have gone up, down, stalemated, etc. Since I still have the old S-Corp (inactive, as far as the State of MT is concerned) I started looking into [business insurance quotes](http://www.localinsurance.com) to boot. Interesting stuff, I swear. Let's start with the health. When I was actively making loot as CEO/owner of Alpha Solutions Inc., I kept a Blue Cross / Blue Shield policy for my health insurance. Not much coverage, but not much cost per month. Win/Win AND Lose/Lose. Nice. If I were to do it again, I would most certainly combine my heath with my [Montana business insurance](http://www.localinsurance.com/montana/) (add your own state here...[California business insurance](http://www.localinsurance.com/california/), etc) for both savings and ease. I would probably increase my coverage from 'detrimental' to 'actually get a sprained ankle looked at' levels, as well. ![humanoid](/uploads/2010/06/crutches.jpg "crutches") Might help. I did think this was pretty epic. ![small man](/uploads/2010/06/zero-feet.jpg "zero-feet") I'd say that if you are zero feet tall, then maybe you should not be looking for insurance. Or, you should be looking for a great deal of insurance. Might be time to look into a talk show career, and then into the [California Department of Insurance](http://www.insurance.ca.gov) upon arriving to Hollywood. I wonder if a sub-one-foot-tall person could type with his/her tiny little fingers. Might be comical.
