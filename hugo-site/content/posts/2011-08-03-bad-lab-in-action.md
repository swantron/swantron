My enjoyable night of programming my IOIO slowly devolved into a digital multimeter-needing mess. \[caption id="attachment\_3719" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="bad lab"\][![bad lab in action](/uploads/2011/08/lab-in-action.jpg "lab-in-action")](/uploads/2011/08/lab-in-action.jpg)\[/caption\] Either I am reading the spec sheet incorrectly, or this thing is wonky. I have implemented a pull-up resister, and \*should be pushing 5V. In reality, I am seeing 3.8V...something is amiss. Back to the drawing board.
