My enjoyable night of programming my IOIO slowly devolved into a digital multimeter-needing mess. ![bad lab in action](/uploads/2011/08/lab-in-action.jpg "lab-in-action") Either I am reading the spec sheet incorrectly, or this thing is wonky. I have implemented a pull-up resister, and \*should be pushing 5V. In reality, I am seeing 3.8V...something is amiss. Back to the drawing board.
