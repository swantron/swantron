Some will remember Steve "The Croc Hunter" Irwin for his daring exploits with dangerous animals. I will remember Steve Irwin as the only dude who can give Michael Jackson a run for his money in reckless stunts involving their infant children. ![steveirwin.JPG](/uploads/2006/09/steveirwin.JPG)Homeboy was stung in the heart by a stingray this morning. I like to think Steve stung us all in the hearts with his zaniness. Cranky.
