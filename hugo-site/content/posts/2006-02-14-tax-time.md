 I knocked out my taxes at the Pub Hippo this year. Did you? ![hiptwo.jpg](/uploads/2006/02/hiptwo.jpg)![hipone.jpg](/uploads/2006/02/hipone.jpg)For those in the dark, the Hippo is home to the 22 oz Kiboko...cheap beer in a funny looking pimp cup. I prefer my Pub Pilsner, which I suppose to be Busch Light, with a healthy dose of Clamato. I love Wi-Fi.
