So, I didn't win the Montana Millionaire grand prize, $100,000 prize, $10,000 prize, or even the consolation slap-in-the-face-fifty-dollar-instant-win prize. Really had my hopes up for that guy. Turns out, I'm still spending 45 hours a week in my cubical, with my dual monitors and hot sauce. I switched from my plastic coffee cup to a glass one (pickle jar) which is nice. Aside from that...it is business as usual. Needless to say, ample day-dreaming time in conjunction with a crack at a cool million got me thinking...what the hell would I actually blow some loot on, if it was there. That has led me to this...pondering getting an [emergency loan](http://www.elastic.com) and doing some awesome stuff with it. Buckle up, because this list is all over the fricking place. 1 ) Trade the Viseo LCD in on a Samsung LED. Embrace the future! LEDs look great and are energy efficient...for the hippies. ![](/uploads/2010/01/samsung_led.jpg "samsung_led") 2 ) Check out Japan. Sea food and robots...PEWPEWPEW. Tokyo has a giant Gundam statue, for christ-sake. ![](/uploads/2010/01/gundam-statue.jpg "gundam-statue") 3 ) Get my ass back into robotics. My last project (solar following flower) did not succeed. Boo. I think I could do better with... 4 ) Arduino...
> Arduino is an open-source electronics prototyping platform based on flexible, easy-to-use hardware and software. It's intended for artists, designers, hobbyists, and anyone interested in creating interactive objects or environments.

Plus, it is Linux compatable, and you can do sweet stuff like this...DIY GameBoy ![](/uploads/2010/01/gameboy-arduino.jpg "gameboy-arduino") 5 ) Destination wedding...and 6 ) Honeymoon: Bahamas with Kate. Since the engagement ring wiped out the ol' savings account, I loan would make for a nice honeymoon. ![fruity drinks](/uploads/2010/01/bahamas.jpg "bahamas") 7 ) Truckload of Advil. Those fruity drinks ^ give me headaches. Pretty sure I'd need a truckload. 8 ) 5+3. I have a problem. I pretty much cannot see a Netbook without wanting to buy it. Same goes for bad-ass notebooks, like the Alienware M17x. So sweet...especially once you wipe the sucker clean and install Linux. FTW! ![gaming laptop](/uploads/2010/01/alienware-m17x-gaming-laptop.jpg "alienware-m17x-gaming-laptop") 9 ) Trip to Mesa...might be the last Cubs Spring Ball in Arizona. Spring ball is third, only to fall/summer ball...which leads me to... 10 ) Trip to Wrigley. Especially during October. ![](/uploads/2010/01/wrigley-field.jpg "wrigley-field") I also would need a truckload of Advil after Wrigley...they practically give away those Old Styles.
