Since I'm really dragging my feet in regards to posting anything of substance, take a quick look at my new Aoyue soldering station. \[caption id="attachment\_2568" align="aligncenter" width="550" caption="also pictured: clutter"\][![soldering station](/uploads/2010/08/solder-iron.jpg "solder-iron")](/uploads/2010/08/solder-iron.jpg)\[/caption\] It works like a champ...pretty pumped that I heeded Lady Ada's advice on this one. I still need to post my Motor Shield assembly pics. I also really need to post some stuff about the Droid 2...which is constantly blowing my mind. Stick around...it'll happen.
