This year marks the 109*th* meeting of the MSU Bobcats and the Montana Grizzlies football squads... the good ol' [Brawl of the Wild](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brawl_of_the_Wild). Cat/Griz is always a big deal around Bozeman, and, dare I say, it just got a [whole lot more ridiculous](http://bozemandailychronicle.com/articles/2009/11/19/news/100catgriz.txt)... FTA:
> <font color="000000">published on Wednesday, November 18, 2009 10:44 PM MST By GAIL SCHONTZLER Chronicle Staff Writer Excitement over Saturday’s 109th ‘Cat-Griz football showdown is inspiring all kinds of lunacy, starting with the first-ever Undie Run for blue and gold diehards. “I think it’s fabulous,” said Teresa Snyder, president of the Associated Students of Montana State University. “Everyone is going to strip down to blue and gold underwear and run to Bobcat Plaza. I have a feeling it will be hysterical.”</font>
I have a feeling that this horrible idea will be far from hysterical. However, she continues... > <font color="000000">“Hands down, I’m going,” Snyder said, laughing. “These are the fun things that make people remember their college experience.”</font>

Idiot. I can say with some level of certainty that I had a good time in college. A very good time in fact. I'll also go out on a limb and say that my college experience would not have been bettered by running around with a bunch of assholes in "undies." Anyhow...go Cats. And go Champ. ![this guy still cracks me up](/uploads/2009/11/champ.jpg "champ")
