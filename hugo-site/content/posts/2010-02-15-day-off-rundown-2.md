Happy Presidents Day. I like Taft, because he was fat. Here is what I did, on my day off from banking software. 1) Attacked our clogged kitchen sink dilemma, again. ![snake...ftl](/uploads/2010/02/IMG00024.jpg "drain-snake") ~~Pretty glad I opted not to be a plumber, even though I rule at plumbing. Not really about the ruling, but I most assuredly would hate to be a plumber. ![snake, also ftl](/uploads/2010/02/IMG00025.jpg "snake-drain") 2) Busted out the vacuum. Pretty sure I opted not to be a vacuum-er for my profession. I'm pretty good with a vacuum, though. ![spelled wrongly](/uploads/2010/02/IMG00026.jpg "vaccum") 3) 5.5 miles on the elliptical. Hulu is the best thing to happen to working out at home, and Nova is the best thing to happen to Hulu. I learned about deciphering Mayan writing today. It was pretty awesome. ![elliptical trainer](/uploads/2010/02/IMG00027.jpg "elliptical") 4) Did a little spray paint art...a.k.a. "Man Art" It will eventually be a samurai...pretty manish. ![mona lisa of rattle cans](/uploads/2010/02/IMG00028.jpg "spray-paint-art") 5) Currently, doing a little blogging, with Smokie on Pandora in the background. It's a wrap.
