Getting close to having my live wallpaper on the Android Market. I've hammered down the image, polished up the cube, tested the app on several emulators, and optimized the rotaion rate. More importantly, I haven't drop kicked my notebook or tossed my Droid 2 out the door. I'm going to chalk this one up as a... **+1 probably the best Android App developer I know of**. For the win. I don't know any other Android app developers, but I'm still giving this a big For the win. Here is a sneak peak of said wallpaper: ![new cube](/uploads/2011/01/new_cube.jpg "new_cube") Not too shabby, huh? I'll figure out how to sign the cert tomorrow, and see if I can get an account started with Google. Stay tuned, Android folk. I'm going to offer this for free.99, so you all better fire this up on your mobiles and report some bugs. Stay tuned.
