I'm all about Google. It is no secret that Android gives me the warm and fuzzies; I suppose that is the root of my affection. As I sit here, looking at my quickly-dying BlackBerry Pearl, I'm counting down the days until I can blog via my HTC Incredible. It will be, undoubtedly, incredible. Especially since I can have the Android holler at my Arduino, and vice versa. My warm and fuzzies just turned into warmer and fuzziers. Enough about that. Today, we are talking Google Apps. Buy into the cloud computing revolution, my friends, as it is upon us. Google is far more than the search engine of times earlier: ![google](/uploads/2010/06/google.jpg "google") If you haven't received the memo, there now exists Google Apps: ![google apps](/uploads/2010/06/google-apps.jpg "google-apps") Long story short, Google Apps allows you to free up system space by whisking your info into the clouds. Cloud computing is the future...no need to keep several TBs of data locally, when info can be collected and accessed via an online warehouse. Check out the [Google Apps Marketplace](http://www.google.com/enterprise/marketplace/viewListing?productListingId=4970+4188150475217982560), if you don't believe me. Secure solutions for practically any info that was once married to one particular machine or server. I stumbled across this site, after they asked me to blog for dough about them... [Mavenlink](http://www.mavenlink.com) is on the cutting edge of the Google Apps scene. Login with your Google ID, and you are given direct integration with Gmail, Google Calendar, Google Sites, et. al. Now that [Mavenlink is now integrated with Google Apps](http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/mavenlink-now-integrated-with-google-apps-96461759.html), sharing info is easy as whistling Dixie. As far as I can tell, the ease of and subsequent utilization of Google Docs alone would pay for itself in absolutely no time. Perhaps I'm jaded after far-too-long spent accessing user shared folders and fighting firewall rules, but I feel that documents in the cloud is a superior means of disseminating information. Hit one of those links and see for yourself. I'm going to go look at some more Android spec sheets. So excited.
