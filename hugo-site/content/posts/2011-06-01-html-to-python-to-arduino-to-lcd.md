Last week found me standing tall upon my shell script soapbox, shouting command line praises to all who would listen. *Thou ought direct thine output aftways, to-wards thine USB port of thee. And that is well and righteous.* Well, that still is the case. My latest project has made it glaringly obvious that sometimes a little Python script will render a whole bunch of shell scripting moot. Namely, parsing HTML. Let's see a picture... ![outdoor hacking](/uploads/2011/06/outdoor-computer.jpg "outdoor-computer") Lunch hour project: **parse the comments from swantron.com; feed said comments to an LCD screen.** I was horsing around with wget from a CLI a few days ago. I found myself trying to smash through the resultant file via pure regular expressions...which is incredibly clumsy. Well, as luck would have it, my go-to after my main go-to is Python, and this type of thing has been issue enough to warrant a library. BeautifulSoup. It acts to parse the HTML info into items, that can be smashed around as I see(med) fit. My setup was simple: py script to snag my comments and write serial, Arduino sketch to drive a LCD and read/write serial. And a source of shade. And a WiFi signal to snag. ![mobile mobile](/uploads/2011/06/outdoor-hacking.jpg "outdoor-hacking") Check, check, check, etc. Video time: <iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="427" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/4nyInt_5HHU" width="569"></iframe>Pretty slick...hit the fold for the code, as promised, and a summary.
