Guess what back to school means to me...a longer commute to and from work. Dodging coeds isn't as fun as it sounds. Well, maybe cutting extremely close to bikers is fun. Actually, that is very fun. The only real bonus to this time of year is for the barn-burner sales that pop up for technology aimed at students. If there is any chance that a college bound dude or dudette will be shopping for a tech item of some sort, chances are high that that item will be super cheap, somewhere. Case in point...how about some [discounts at HP](http://www.savings.com/m-Hewlett-Packard-coupons.html)![awesome](/uploads/2010/09/hp.jpg "hp") (say what you will...I still want one of those damned HPs with the flip around screen...badly) I was poking around Savings.com, and noticed that they have all sorts of deals that are aimed at students. Free shipping and all sorts of discounts on HP notebooks, ink, you name it. They also had some deals from Verizon regarding Droid phones and $50 off. I'm somewhat upset that I bought my Droid 2 without checking out the back to school deals. Anyhow, hit that link to see what I'm talking about. I'll be playing with my phone, and wishing I was playing with a picture of my phone on my swivelly HP netbook.
