This should go on 26outs.com, but, hey, why not throw it here. Sweet Lou is hanging up his manager-cleats at the end of the 2010 season. \[caption id="attachment\_2475" align="aligncenter" width="510" caption="not so sweet, lou"\][![sweet lou](/uploads/2010/07/piniella_retires.jpg "piniella_retires")](/uploads/2010/07/piniella_retires.jpg)\[/caption\] Too bad. I was hoping Piniella would surpass Bobby Cox in the 'most times sent to the showers early' category. Sad day in Mudville.
