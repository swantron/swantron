What a week! I just got back to town after one hell of a vacation. I was almost too busy to celebrate the birth of Jesus of Nazareth, which coincidentally falls very near to the winter solstice. Whatever. I started by getting back together with the ol' gang from high school. Not much has changed for the most part. ![](http://bouncerblog.com/wp-content/wo5.jpg)Then Griff and ShirtShopTony did some cool ballooning. ![](http://bouncerblog.com/wp-content/weirdos2.JPG)Lastly. upon arriving back to Bozeman I swung down to the Legion to check the schedule only to find the 'Hoff enjoying a cocktail. Mitch Buchanan himself. David was nice enough to pose for a quick picture before ordering another Gui Thai. ![](http://bouncerblog.com/wp-content/wo3.jpg)
