It kills me a little bit inside every time I boot into Windows at work. Just a little bit. It seems like Microsoft is following Canonical's lead, by introducing an Ubuntu-like hover bar deal to the taskbar in Windows 7. I won't bother myself with figuring out who is doing the aping...we'll just leave it at that. Anyhow, the first real impressive feature I have found with Windows 7 is seamless handling of multiple monitors. \[caption id="attachment\_3878" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="+3"\][![three monitors on windows 7](/uploads/2011/10/problem-solved-570x342.jpg "problem-solved")](/uploads/2011/10/problem-solved.jpg)\[/caption\] Getting triple monitors was \*nearly plug and play. A few resolution tweaks and a reordering was all it took. For what it is worth, that monitor placement is strategic. Suffice to say my view is much, much better now. (shutters)
