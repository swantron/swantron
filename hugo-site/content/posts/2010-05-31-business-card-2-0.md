Ramiro...I dig your style. ![ramiro](/uploads/2010/05/usb-card.jpg "usb-card") Spanish telecom extraordinaire and all around hero Ramiro Pareja Veredas has the coolest business cards ever. Printed onto a card, with a male USB interface...if you have the pleasure of getting one of these from ol' Ramiro, you can plug it into your computer and see his HTML resume, etc. ![usb](/uploads/2010/05/usb-business-card.jpg "usb-business-card") Per Ramiro himself:
> Clearly, it is not the cheaper business card in the world (about 5 euros/piece for a small batch order), but it is a (relatively) small price for having a card in your pocket that has more CPU power than the computer that led the man to the moon.

I wonder if Ramiro knows about the internet...it seems like his HTML resume could easily be placed on that thing. I'm not much of a computer guy, though...I could be wrong. +1 interesting. +1 nerdy +1 moon reference -1 I'd still throw it directly in the trash, as I do with all other business cards I procure.
