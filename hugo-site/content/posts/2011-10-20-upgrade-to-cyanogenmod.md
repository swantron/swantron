My relationship with Motorola's firmware has ended. It was a good run...well, no. That is a lie. It was certainly better after rooting my Droid 2 and wiping out Verizon's boatware, but the Moto\* junk had to go too. I finally decided to gut everything and install [Cyanogenmod](http://www.cyanogenmod.com/) yesterday. It is plus one awesome. Although the process of flashing Cyanogenmod's firmare involves a little work, it is no more difficult than rooting the phone in the first place. Since I did that a while ago, I really wasn't concerned with blowing up my warranty...I figured bricking the thing would either result in some sweet haxxing or a new phone. Win / win. I would suggest an upgrade to anyone. My phone finally screams, as it should have from day one. My battery life is better | everything imaginable is configurable | my apps and Google accounts all work | and, wait for it, I don't have to kill processes all day. In fact, I don't have a stand-alone task killer going...that is pretty surreal still. Well, as with any exercise of this nature, backing up is imperative. Astro File Manager is great...Titanium Backup is great. The other players are the same too...ClockworkMod Recovery makes snagging the MODs easy. I am actually running a daily build, since there is not an official stable build for the Droid 2 yet. No memory leaks though, and everything so far has been functional. Anyhow, on to the actual firmware stuff. I downloaded the zip file, and booted into recovery mode... ![cyanogenmod 7.1 install android](/uploads/2011/10/cyanogenmod1-570x427.jpg "cyanogenmod") ...during game one of the World Series. Not sure if that is Pujols or Furcal in the reflection. Either way. Great picture, huh? This is the first time I have used my webcam since upgrading to Ubuntu 9.11. Whoops...screwed up the camera, fellas. On the screen is a ClockworkMod selection for Google's bits. I imagine that this was done for legal reasons. Anyhow, I had to go back and install this from recovery, as I missed it at first. ![CG7.1 android installation droid 2](/uploads/2011/10/cyanogenmod71-570x429.jpg "cyanogenmod7") Hi Katie. ^ I also managed to get stuck in a boot loop of sorts during my first attempt. It turns out that I cleared the data but not the cache from the recovery menu. No good. A pulled battery and some troubleshooting and we were good to go. ![cyanogenmod boot loop](/uploads/2011/10/cyanogenmod7-droid2.png "cyanogenmod7-droid2") I spun up the Android market, and did fresh installs of my apps. For the important stuff (the Angry Birds Trilogy, 9 Innings Pro Baseball, et. al.) I pulled the backup data back over top of things. No issues. I had been wanting a landscaped workspace since I got my phone. .. now I know why... ![landscape mode on cm7](/uploads/2011/10/cyanogenmod7-landscape-570x320.png "cyanogenmod7-landscape") It just makes sense. CM7 allows this to be configured. Like basically everything else. Want your menu on the bottom? Put it there. There are options all over the map...like the camera exposure, for instance. ![camera function CM7.1](/uploads/2011/10/cyanogenmod71-camera-570x320.png "cyanogenmod71-camera") Sweet. It is tough to beat the performance gains in general, but it is wholly possible. Check this out: ![Cyanogen Warning Dragons Ahead](/uploads/2011/10/overclock-cyanogenmod.png "overclock-cyanogenmod") One stop overclocking. Disregard that popup and go nuts. One part of me wishes that mobile carriers would take note of Cyanogenmod's presence and push Android updates to customers. The other part of me likes to void warranties and do things that the clowns from Verizon frown upon. Either way, my phone is now awesome...that is all that matters.
