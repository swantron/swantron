Tending bar was easy money. Hang on for a sec...I'll get to it, via a roundabout, Android laden path. ![d](/uploads/2010/09/droid2.jpg "droid2") As a new Droid 2 owner, I'm all about my apps. You know what? There are a lot of awful apps floating around the market place and or webs. There are some incredibly useful apps, both free and for purchase. I have purchased but one Android app so far...and I'm not embarrassed in the least to say that it is the paid version of Robo Defence. It both kicks ass at home, and at the job. In fact, I can barely make it through a meeting, that is, if I drop the ball and leave GPS rolling and nuke my battery, rendering my phone useless for a half-hour-turned-into-seventy-horrible-minutes-of-repeating-the-same-crap-from-the-last-twelve-emails. I mean meetings. I mean, I wish I could use my phone at work. But, I digress. I like apps. Wouldn't it be great, if there was some sort of app out there, that would pay you. Sit down, y'all...there is. Mobile plus marketing equals [mobile marketing](http://wereward.com). Getting paid to play, in a nutshell. This has been an incredibly long-winded intro to an easily summed-up moral of the story. I really think that WeReward has hit the nail on the head, and created the easiest means of making money I have ever encountered. Granted, I have tended a lot of bar, which is both easy and simultaneously a giant pain in the ass. How about getting paid to check into an advertiser's place of business? Sounds okay...right? Hear an ad, respond to add, do nothing more, get some loot. Not too shabby. I caught a video on a Fox affiliate about these guys and an iPhone app. Basically, they were pulling fifty bucks a month for taking pictures from some places that popped up on their phones. They have the same stuff for we Android users, and will have you RIM suckers covered in no time. Hit that link above for some more info...it is pretty slick.
