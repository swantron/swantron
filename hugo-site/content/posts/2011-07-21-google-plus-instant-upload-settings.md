I am still horsing around with Google+ on my Droid 2. A few posts back, I lambasted the Instant Upload feature. The whole idea of tossing geo-location-having pictures onto Google's servers seems awfully odd to me. As this feature is 'featured' in Google+'s Android app, I figured I would play around with it some more, in order to gauge its evilness. The jury is still out. It does work as intended. I snapped a few pictures of my fancy breakfast in my cubicle, with the Instant Upload activated, with the Battery Uploads selection... ![cubicle bacon via instant upload](/uploads/2011/07/cubicle-bacon.jpg "cubicle-bacon") Surely enough, once I plugged my D2 into the charger, it began to sync/upload. Within several seconds I was notified of my complete upload to G+. So, while I am still unsure of the impacts of this feature, I am impressed by its function. Google's devs hit the ball out on the park with this one, in regards to pure functionality. Especially, as the Android Facebook and Twitter apps are rough at best. Hats off. Expect a full review of G+ in the near future.
