Every nerd's favourite webcomic was extra nerdy today, April Fool's Day... \[caption id="attachment\_1893" align="aligncenter" width="873" caption="randall get out of my head"\][![randall get out of my head](/uploads/2010/04/unixkcd.jpg "unixkcd")](/uploads/2010/04/unixkcd.jpg)\[/caption\] (hit the pix link for full-sized) I need to view the source and figure out how Randall managed to emulate a fricking terminal on xkcd, but mad props nonetheless. \*\*\*bonus points for the lame "top command" joke\*\*\*
