I'm not one to be down-and-out-self-deprecating-bummed-out about things in general, but iRobot has just made my tri-colored LED progress look like peanuts. Tri-colored peanuts, but peanuts nonetheless. Hats off to you all, iRobot dudes. This is awesome. ![robo laser](/uploads/2010/06/robo-laser.jpg "robo-laser") From spectrum.ieee.org:
> iRobot released today new video of its Warrior robot, a beefed up version of the more well-known PackBot, demonstrating use of the APOBS (Anti-Personnel Obstacle Breaching System), an explosive line charge deployed by a rocket, with a small parachute holding back the end of the line. The APOBS, iRobot says, is designed for "deliberate breaching of anti-personnel minefields and multi-strand wire obstacles." Although it may concern those who don't like the arming of robots, it makes great eye candy for those who like robots, rockets, and explosions.

For those who like robots, rockets, and explosions? Throw in Katie and Old Milwaukee Light, and that is me to a T.
