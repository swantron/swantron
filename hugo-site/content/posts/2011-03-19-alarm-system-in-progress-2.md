I suppose I should add a few words. I placed the images in an empty post several days ago, and sort of forgot to update the text on mi telephono. Dios mio! \[caption id="attachment\_3263" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="netbook action shot"\][![speaker](/uploads/2011/03/speaker-wire.jpg "speaker-wire")](/uploads/2011/03/speaker-wire.jpg)\[/caption\] Well, long story short. I put together the little POC using my PIR sensor a while back. The shit deal, is that the sucker only writes high and low. Easy, for the win. Limited, for the loss. I may or may not have (I did) disassembled a few CRT TVs last month. Hence, have all sorts of components, such as small sub 9V speakers... \[caption id="attachment\_3264" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="the wires are wire-y"\][![wires](/uploads/2011/03/audio-project.jpg "audio-project")](/uploads/2011/03/audio-project.jpg)\[/caption\] I'm trying to do something with a dual speaker setup, in order to shine up my bugler alarm project. The code is boring...stay tuned...I might be able to come up with something amusing.
