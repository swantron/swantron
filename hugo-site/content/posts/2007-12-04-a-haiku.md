While Katie is in Las Vegas preparing for Suzie and Josh's wedding, I have the honor of caring for her beta, LaMonte. For what it is worth, I call him Ken and he doesn't seem to mind. His bowl is stemware, as are the beer serving pieces at the Pub Hippo...thus provided the inspiration for the following: **Fishsitting for Kate. Your home is a Kiboko; Float around and poop.**
