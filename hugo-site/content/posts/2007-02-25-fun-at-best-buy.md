Grif's trips through Billings all feature shopping stops at Best Buy...his five hard drives are all testaments to this. This ugly little dude apparently enjoys Best Buy for a different reason. <object height="350" width="425"><param name="movie" value="http://embed.break.com/MjMzNjI5"></param><embed height="350" src="http://embed.break.com/MjMzNjI5" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425"></embed></object>I find myself simultaneously hating and feeling sorry for the kid...sort of confusing. Enjoy.
