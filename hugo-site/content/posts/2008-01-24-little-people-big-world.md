I love these guys ![surfs up](/uploads/2008/01/littlepeoplebigworld.jpg)Here is the program description for tonight's show:
> New, "A Little surgery; Marty Comes to Town". (2007). Grandpa Ron and Grandma Peg join the family in Oakland for Zach's leg surgery; family friend Marty Klebba stops by to cheer him up and winds up in a wrestling match with Amy. (Reality)

Good...Marty Klebba is in this one. Who exactly is Marty Klebba, and just who did he have to blow to get that billing? I hope Amy puts him in a little tiny arm bar.
