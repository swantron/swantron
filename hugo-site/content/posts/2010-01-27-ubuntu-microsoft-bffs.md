Ubuntu's maker, Canonical, has announced that Lucid Lynx will drop with Yahoo Search as the default for Firefox. Since Yahoo is powered by Bing, M$ is effectively in bed with a fricking Linux distro... World colliding ![ubuntu FTW](/uploads/2010/01/ubuntuwhite.jpg "ubuntuwhite") Granted, it takes about 5 seconds to configure Firefox to use Google as it does in Koala, but it is a step in the right direction for Canonical... Contracts with Dell and now M$ via Yahoo will help gain market share. Maybe 2011 will be the year of the Linux desktop... Not very likely, but less M$ is a victory in my book. Addition by subtraction.
