I have to admit that I'm pretty impressed by the Foscam's IR capabilities. I snapped a screenshot on my Droid last while we were getting the princess ready for her bath... ![android night vision](/uploads/2012/03/android-night-vision.png "android-night-vision") The lab was light-free, and I was connected to the camera's web server via my 3G connection. Controls are fairly snappy, and the image looks good even when pushed via cellular. Response time is very quick on the network itself...but remoting in to the router does the trick nicely. I'm keeping my eyes peeled for a second cam...set designated choppable. We'll see...I'm growing attached to this guy, but really want to get into its guts.
