My light needs were not being met in the lab. Garage, lab, whatever. Anyhow, I picked up a halogen work light at the hardware store, thinking that the base dimensions and output would make for a perfect movable lab light source. This thing is a monster. Check this out. Reference voltage: ![base voltage](/uploads/2011/03/reference-volatage.jpg "reference-volatage") Reference tempurature ![base](/uploads/2011/03/halogen-output.jpg "halogen-output") Voltage with 40W light bulb: ![better](/uploads/2011/03/lamp-voltage.jpg "lamp-voltage") Voltage with Man-Lamp: (maxed out) ![boom](/uploads/2011/03/man-voltage1.jpg "man-voltage") Wait for it...wait for it...wait for it...TEMP NEAR MAN-LAMP ![what](/uploads/2011/03/man-tempurature.jpg "man-tempurature") Incredible. I guess this could double as a goddamned heater. My digital thermo was still climbing at 145. FWIW, it is perfect for the lab. Just sort of confusing how brutish it is. Impressive.
