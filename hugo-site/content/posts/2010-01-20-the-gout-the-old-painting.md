Well, since I'm on day fucking six of my gout attack, I figure I should post a painting I came across during my allopurinol research. A mediocre painter named James Gillray made this sucker in 1799, and titled it "The Gout." ![](/uploads/2010/01/Gout.jpg "Gout") I feel for the guy, as he managed to get sort of spot-on with this thing. Fire out the nose...big teeth...ect. Too bad he sucks at painting.
