[![](/uploads/2009/12/triscuit.jpg "triscuit")](/uploads/2009/12/triscuit.jpg)To whom it may concern at Nabisco, I love your Triscuit wheat crackers. I am, however, confused by the spelling of "Triscuit." Is this some sort of play on words with "biscuit?" When I think about whole grain crackers, bisquits do not come to mind. Also, your slogan is very retarded. Regards, Joe
