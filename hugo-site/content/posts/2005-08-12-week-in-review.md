What an interesting week in photos. I am amused for sure, but too feel slightly uneasy at the sights captured by my cellie cam. Check these out; chant some AC/DC. Monday morning. I spot this hard-rocker hard-rockin' an agressive mullet. You cannot see the yellow mirrored lenses on this hombre's Gargoyles, but you can imagine.

Athleticism? Youbetcha. Her abnormality lies in the fact that she is smoking two cigs at once. Go easy my friend. ![](http://www.bouncerblog.com/wp-content/photo_0030_o2_01.jpg)This guy can go to hell. Wednesday finds this dude with a NateDawg Bozo Fro bitching about my skid-steer's noisiness. You work construction homeboy. Nice overalls...check out the Carhartt sale at Murdoch's...you can purchase a slightly irregular pair of those bibs for a fraction of their MSRP ![](http://www.bouncerblog.com/wp-content/photo_0032_o2_01.jpg)Thursday afternoon. Hi. I deliver plants. My moustache is sweet. Sweet too are my cowboy boots. I also enjoy wearing t-shirts depicting cartoon characters. ~that is Wylie Coyote~ Also, I am a grown man. ![](http://www.bouncerblog.com/wp-content/photo_0034_o2_01.jpg)Later Thursday. Six o' clock, sixer of Bud. Workin for the weekend and then TGIF for this guy. Mullet with a sweet goatee.
