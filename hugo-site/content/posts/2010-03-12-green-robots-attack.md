Green robots are the best robots. Like this gem I drew for Katie... ![](/uploads/2010/03/green-robot-1024x768.jpg "green-robot") I had to wipe out the technical specs from that document via a slick combination of MS Paint rectangle selects, MS Paint deletes, MS Paint bucket things, and MS Paint spray paint things. Pretty awesome. I think I'm speaking for everybody when I say that I hope that my green robot phase last for a long, long time. Beats drawing hot snauce bottles, nawmeen...
