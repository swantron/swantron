Wow. I am not sure if Jesus or Jeb Bush is behind this, but it looks as if the Tampa Bay Devil Rays are no longer as of the 2008 season. Say hello to the Tampa Bay Rays! Lovely home uniforns ![dray.jpg](/uploads/2007/09/dray.jpg)Lovely road uniforms ![dray2.jpg](/uploads/2007/09/dray2.jpg)I am curious what South Florida Little League team's uniform served as the model for these beauts. Back up...what FL grocery store sponsored the Little League team that inspired the design of this horrible design .My money is on Ray's.
