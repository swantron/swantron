Wheat Thins are boring, by design. What is a guy to do, when at work with a bunch of boring-ass W Thins? Easy. Arrange the hell out of the stupid little things and hot snauce them up. Hot snauce the crap out of them. ![red lobster](/uploads/2010/08/red-lobster.jpg "red-lobster") Here, I went for a crude lobster formation. If you get a little crazy with said hot snauce, don't worry. I spent the rest of my afternoon with a small red snauce stain on my yellow notepad. Either my co-workers failed to notice, or thought I was crazy and avoided a rambling culinary pep talk. +1 Spicy
