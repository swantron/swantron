My sidekick is already dabbling in solid state physics... ![tron baby](/uploads/2012/01/tron-baby-570x320.jpg "tron-baby") ...namely, the optics around the 440 nanometer range. She is oxidizing some bilirubin into biliverdin. I have a bunch of RBG LEDs on my workbench...maybe I should go slap together an auxiliary biliblanket. DIY neonatal hack...
