I remember how excited I was when I picked up my first BlackBerry Pearl. My new, shiny, metallic, trackball-having, Brick Breaker playing, T9 is history-making-me-say, Blackberry Pearl. That bad boy had a two inch screen, if you measured it diagonally. I swear. Actually, I have it sitting on my work bench right now. One second... I was wrong...it is easily two and a quarter. Diagonal. So the question at hand is quickly becoming an age-old question. What do we do with all of this tech once it hits the end of the road? For phones, this is increasingly hard...the older unit is too nice to toss, but too slow to hit paydirt on eBay. Now what? I'd like to be coy and say something like "two words...\[two words here\]"...but URLs cross me up. So...here you go....check out [sellcell.com](http://www.sellcell.com). They can solve the problem of which I speak. \[caption id="attachment\_2854" align="aligncenter" width="569" caption="too...many....phones...."\][![cool new phone](/uploads/2010/11/cool_new_phone.jpg "cool_new_phone")](/uploads/2010/11/cool_new_phone.jpg)\[/caption\] We still have a big ol' tube TV upstairs. What do you do with a cathode ray tube? You can toss it in the trash, dropping heavy metals in the water table. You could bring it out to the sticks, and use it for target practice with a rifle. Or shotgun, equipped with slugs. Not that I would know, but that may make for a good target, albeit another way to pollute the crap out of the water run-off. Fortunately for us (and quite unfortunately for the gun toting hillbillies) there are options when it comes to cell phones. I am proud to say that the cellular market has become pervasive enough to allow for [cell phone recycling](http://www.sellcell.com) to take root. Even if you are completely over your cell phone, there are people willing to recycle it for you. They will give you far more loot for your old unit, provided it has a market value...i.e. it is not a Zach Morris phone. Or a BB Pearl. Snaps. Well, I would say long story short, but my story was long to begin with. Long story in summation, a reputable EU company is extending their service to the US. They provide the best option out there, as far as uses for old cell phones are concerned. They are doing so well, that they can pay me to write about their launch in the States...dang. Hit one of those links to see what is up. I'm still looking at my old BlackBerry...how pathetic does that little sucker look? Plus, nothing happens when you push on that screen...ghetto as hell.
