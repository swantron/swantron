I am not a huge fan of my gigantic Dell backpack that I was issued at work. It is way too boxy, way too uncomfortable, and way too weird looking. Long story short, I ended up online looking at [Laptop Cases](http://www.gotbags.com). There was some good stuff. My personal favorite that I found was this guy: ![swimmy swammy swanson samsonite](/uploads/2011/11/swimmy_swammy.png "swimmy_swammy") Suffice to say I have been called Samsonite. A few times. Anyhow, on the search I ran into a site called gotbags.com. I was frankly impressed by their prices...a lot better deals than I expected to find. From [Laptop Bags For Women](http://www.gotbags.com/laptop-bags/womens-laptop-bags) to [Britto Luggage](http://www.gotbags.com/brands/britto-by-heys), they have fancy stuff in addition to the more basic laptop bags I was hunting for. Take a look by hitting one of those links.
