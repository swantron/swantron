Good thing the A-squad was on the clock last night, huh Bozeman. Three fights that I know of were stamped out by Kyle, ShirtShop, Bouncer B.O.B., Sergeant Tim Lucas, and who the hell else knows. I am a little sore still, but probably not as sore as I imagine the dude who hit Grif and my new cracked out buddy to be today. We need some gotdamn cameras to document this stuff at the bar I swear. Especially when Grif "can't move" at the end of the night and Waldo gets deputized for cooler stocking purposes. All is well that ends well, I suppose. The Bobcats managed to beat a Div I-A team today, which I am hoping will renew the bouncerblog.com crew's interest in tailgating. Kiboko's are still two bucks at the Hippo, and the internet is still awesome. Case in point: `<object height="350" width="425"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/v1wG9g1wjSA"></param><embed height="350" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/v1wG9g1wjSA" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425"></embed></object>`I think the crew could use a chill night. Stay tuned.
