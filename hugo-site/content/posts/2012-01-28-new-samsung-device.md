Samsung kills it when it comes to hardware...Galaxy S 2 is high on my list, and I'm fairly certain I will end up snagging a Galaxy Tab at some point. Turns out Samsung makes one hell of a baby monitor too... ![samsung device](/uploads/2012/01/2012-01-22_18-40-20_977-570x329.jpg "samsung-monitor") Only the best for the nerd princess...
