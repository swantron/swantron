Sweep is for breakfast around here...implement a knob or be gone. Same principle as the Arduino sweep example from yesterday, but with a potentiometer doing the actual lifting. Lifting? Shifting...heavy shifting. I added a little potentiometer (little blue guy behind the RainBird sprinkler adjustment tool) to control the servo this go-around: \[caption id="attachment\_2543" align="aligncenter" width="550" caption="enhance...enhance"\][![enhance](/uploads/2010/08/knob-arduino.jpg "knob-arduino")](/uploads/2010/08/knob-arduino.jpg)\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment\_2544" align="aligncenter" width="550" caption="more shame...more plugs"\][![knob on arduino](/uploads/2010/08/arduino-knob.jpg "arduino-knob")](/uploads/2010/08/arduino-knob.jpg)\[/caption\] Another success. <voice> <hair>Dang</hair></voice>. Looks like I'm going to have to whip out the soldering iron after all. Not looking forward to this effort; I have a bad feeling that I'm going to fail miserably with the project. Maybe I'll knock it out of the park. Life is a garden, dig it.
