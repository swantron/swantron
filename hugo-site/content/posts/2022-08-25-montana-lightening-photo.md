I don't think there's a contest, but here's my entry.

![](/uploads/2022/08/swanson-lightening-1024x576.jpg)Cellphones are pretty amazing.. that pic was taken through glass via Google Night Sight. The camera operator basically just has to aim at an area and keep the device still for a minute or so. Crazy storm, crazy technology. I would say something like 'the future is here, but the skies are angry', but that that would sound very stupid.  
  
I don't know.. the picture might look pretty awesome on a canvas. It would, without any doubt, look *fucking awesome* on a sleeveless shirt if I crop out the neighbors' houses.
