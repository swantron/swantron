This one was courtesy of deals.woot...and puzzling as hell. I'm not sure what this product is, but the related searches are classic: ![](/uploads/2010/03/amazon-1.jpg "amazon-1") and the comments are super-duper as well: ![](/uploads/2010/03/amazon-2.jpg "amazon-2") Digging the Back to the Future (BTTF) reference. Nicely played. Not as nice as ol' #1, though...some half-life humor is great. Unfortunately, not accurate, since this is a jar of *ore*. Depending upon said ore's richness, I'm supposing that if the details would true, you would still have pretty much the same amount of ore as you ordered, but I digress. Funny stuff. I want some.
