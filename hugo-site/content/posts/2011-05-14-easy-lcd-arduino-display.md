I am tired of looking at wobbly windows full of Eclipse. The best and worst part of the IOIO board is the fact that the libraries are Java-centric...unfortunately, I am in the middle of a 'worst' phase. I am sort of stalemated. Unfortunately, my issue lies in something that should be trivial, namely naming. Once I can figure out how to orient the crap out of these object-ass pins, I will be good to go. Until then...I am going back to the basics. Processing looks so safe and warm. Coziness, for the win. How about a 20 by 4 LCD project? Okay. \[caption id="attachment\_3490" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="+1 blue"\][![easy blue LCD arduino +1 easy](/uploads/2011/05/Blue-LCD.jpg "Blue-LCD")](/uploads/2011/05/Blue-LCD.jpg)\[/caption\] I have had this sitting on the workbench of bad lab for a while. Time to get after it. The unit came assembled, minus the jumpers I needed to plug this into my breadboard for prototyping. Coincidentally, my soldering station needed to come out of retirement. Sixteen pins...sounds about perfect.
