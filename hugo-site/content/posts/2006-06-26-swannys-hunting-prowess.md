Steph, Megs, and I stumbled across this sumbitch at Canyon Ferry this weekend...sometime after a swimming competition that my landlocked ass won. Hurray. ![bull.jpg](/uploads/2006/06/bull.jpg)This is about a six foot bull snake, minus head. I bravely managed to break the things neck, and then to decapitate it with my Wal-Mart purchased, four dollar machete. Thuggish ruggish. I think the blade is still in the Codymeister's boat, and that my odds of seeing it again are slim.
