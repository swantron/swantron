I have two speeds when it comes to projects: percolate and bazooka. Whereas my swantron comment / to / LCD project was bazooka, this Twitter deal has been percolate. Haven't been able to jump in completely, rather, I have been poking this one with a stick. Still poking... ![arduino controlling blue lcd](/uploads/2011/06/lcd-arduino.jpg "lcd-arduino") Making progress...snagging my Twitter page via Python, and dumping it to LCD: ![body and html closing tags on my lcd](/uploads/2011/06/blue-lcd-screen.jpg "blue-lcd-screen") I just need to hammer out some parsing, and I will be good to go. I really need to figure out some sweet regex and drop this whole 'import (some junk)' stuff. Who knows...at this rate, I just may.
