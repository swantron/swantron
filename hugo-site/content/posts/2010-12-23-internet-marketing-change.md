I don't pull punches when it comes to my love / hate relationship with Google. Google may be Big Brother-esque, when it comes to the wi-fi sniffing and general evil empire building. They too are the same company who dropped Android on us, so for that I am thankful. Similarly, the Chrome browser is a "love", but Chromium is most definitely in the "hate" catagory. As a [publisher network](http://www.clickbooth.com/publisher/cpc) conneseur, I can say that I am glad to announce that AdWords may have a competitor. And that, friends, is breaking news. \[caption id="attachment\_2951" align="aligncenter" width="550" caption="Breaking News FTW"\][![Breaking News...For the Win](/uploads/2010/12/SWANTRON2.jpg "SWANTRON2")](/uploads/2010/12/SWANTRON2.jpg)\[/caption\] MS Paint inducing breaking news. AdSense and AdWords are no friends of mine. Here is the basis of my stance. I had swantron.com living as a parked domain for a number of months after re-branding my old site. When I switched it to my primary domain, even though I had a redirect in place, I was flagged for illegial click activity. My appeal was made to deaf ears, though my point was valid. Regardless, I'm proud to say that [Google AdWords, Meet Your Competition: C](http://technorati.com/business/article/google-adwords-meet-your-competition-clickbooth1/)lickbook CPC. The most interesting aspect of Clickbook is that the [cpc network](http://cpc.clickbooth.com/signup.php?user_type=pub) has its sites set on Google Ad\* from the start. Pay attention to some of the "big" sites...look for the Clickbook reminders. You may see some exposure via CNN / ESPN, because they have made the switch. I'm excited. I haven't had much luck with any Ad\* alternatives yet, so I'm the target publisher. Maybe I'll be rolling in the pay per click loot before we know it.
