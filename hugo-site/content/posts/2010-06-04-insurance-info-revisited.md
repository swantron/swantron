Maybe it is because I turned 30. Maybe it is because I am predisposed to worry. Gout *and* worrying? Thanks, folks. Good looking out on the genes. I am sort of an insurance nut. Moreover, I am always trolling for deals...which puts me in a perpetual quest for both better and cheaper insurance. It is a never-ending cycle. I have (ducks jeers) had very very good luck with Geico. Not well enough to steer clear of the [Insurance Information Institute](http://www.iii.org/) website, but good luck anyhow. With two vehicles, a third on the way, health, and renter's insurance in the fray, I need to cover my bases. Fortunately enough, Alpha Solutions Inc. is currently at an idle state per the fine State of Montana, or I would have [business insurance health](http://www.netquote.com/) on my mind as well. Oh, my days with a shovel! How I miss you so! Let me count the ways...one. Getting a tan. Got a little long winded there. Anyhow, I was checking for insurance rates for my gangster whip, the 96 Yukon. Remember this guy from back in the day? ![yukon](/uploads/2010/06/dirty-dirty.jpg "dirty-dirty") Well, I still ride dirty in the Yukon. I'd like to ride cheap and dirty, so there I find myself doing things like this. I stumbled upon NetQuote, and ran through the info gauntlet. Stumbling upon this guy... ![high](/uploads/2010/06/highschool.jpg "highschool") Some high school? You better have some damned high school education before you get all keyboard happy and start firing your personal data into a form. Or alternatively, you should be provided with a pop-up 'go back to damned school, idiot, then look for some damned insurance' box. But again, I digress. Well, long story shorter, I didn't bite. I am paying too much for the Yukon's insurance, but I am saving a ton with my currant renter's/Katie's ring insurance policy. You win some you lose some. At least I am still not horsing around with [small business insurance](http://www.netquote.com/business-insurance/). Always keep it positive. Always.
