It could be argued that the Snuggie pretty much wiped out any credibility our nation had. Snuggie and Crocs, I suppose. Well, twist that knife handle, because somebody went ahead and invented [Pajama Jeans](<http://www.pajamajeans.com/ >). I didn't misspeak. Pajama Jeans. \[caption id="attachment\_1657" align="aligncenter" width="287" caption="creepy sexy robolady is creepy"\][![](/uploads/2010/02/pajama-jeans.jpg "pajama-jeans")](/uploads/2010/02/pajama-jeans.jpg)\[/caption\] ^^^**Tired of looking like a lazy dick at KFC in sweats?** Pajama Jeans are for you, friend. ^^^**Getting too fat, too rapidly, to contain your fat ass with denim?** Pajama Jeans are Cotton/Spandex stretchy wonderment. Problem solved. ^^^**Want to looks classy at the gym?** Just kidding...these look 100% retarded, regardless of setting. ~~steps on soapbox~~~ I bet these things sell like hot cakes, considering the impressive rate at which people are throwing in the towel on basic social tenets. Pajama Jeans would, maybe, make for a good national uniform bottom for the average overweight, responsibly dodging, globally ignorant, Everybody Loves Raymond-watching, American "adult." ~~~steps off soapbox~~
