Disclaimer: I have two baseball games in which to play tomorrow. Play well, FWIW. I am spending my night watching 'Ask an Engineer.' Getting my nerd on (well, FWIW.) ![ask an engineer](/uploads/2011/08/asking-engineer.jpg "asking-engineer") Support [Lady Ada / Adafruit](http://adafruit.com/) via purchasing the type of stuff you see on swantron.com...she is one of the good guys. Have a nice weekend...
