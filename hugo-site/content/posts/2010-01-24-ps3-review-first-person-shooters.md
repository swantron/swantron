Round two of the PS3 piece-meal review: First Person Shooters After horsing around with the PS3 for a few weeks, I think I can finally pen a review of the 'game' portion of the damn thing. I have two games at this point, Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, and Uncharted, Drake's Fortune. Both of these games were gen 1 drops on the PS3, and both have sequels, so to say, with both CoD5 and the new Uncharted receiving great reviews. For our purposes here, the 2nd /vs/ 1st generation doesn't make a ton of difference. ![yeah it's blurry, big whoop. wanna fight about it](/uploads/2010/01/PS3-Controller.jpg "PS3-Controller") ~~~~~~~~my SmackBerry is in need of a replacement...photos are blurry, so I Van Gough-ed the shit out of that pic. The Gimp rules, but I've already spent a ton of time on that soapbox. ~~~~~~~~~ Anyhow, here is the deal. Dual analogue sticks are fucking retarded. I make no effort to hide the fact that I am a Wii fanboi to some extent. Re-learning the dual analogue control scheme using the PS3 controller is more than an issue of fighting up the colloquial learning curve, it is an antiquated means of engaging in gameplay. CoD, World at War for Wii soundly beats CoD4 on PS3 in terms of accuracy, speed, camera control, and whatever else by which one could gauge a FPS. Uncharted, too, feels awkward. Not only in the controls/camera, but the graphics render block-ily in some levels. I suppose the long and short of the deal is that even with it's far superior graphics, the PS3 is still lagging behind the Wii as far as controller interface is concerned. For games (that I don't care for) such as Madden or a traditional console fighter, dual analogue might be the bee's knees. A well-designed Wii game, like Galaxy, Boom Blox, CoD, or Okami will smoke the shit out of anything on the PS3 to this point. With a new Zelda and the sequel to Super Mario Galaxy slated to drop in 2010, pretty sure I'm going to be plugging AAs in my Wii-motes for some time to come.
