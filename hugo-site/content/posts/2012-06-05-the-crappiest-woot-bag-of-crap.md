Hefty? In need of a red shirt? ![crappy woot boc](/uploads/2012/06/crappiest_bag_of_crap.jpg "crappiest_bag_of_crap") My third Woot BOC showed up, and lived up to its name. Incredibly crappy. Unboxing... <iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="427" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/zYCpc6f2Big" width="569"></iframe>Sort of sad that the Fuji 1.5V long life AA was the surprise hero of the box. I'm serious about the shirt. I'll ship.
