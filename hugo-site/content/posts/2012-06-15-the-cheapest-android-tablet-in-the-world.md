Fifty bucks. Fifty. \[caption id="attachment\_4604" align="alignnone" width="999"\][![cheap android tablet](/uploads/2012/06/Cruz_Tab.jpg "Cruz_Tab")](https://swantron.com/the-cheapest-android-tablet-in-the-world/cruz_tab/) Velocity Cruz Tablet\[/caption\] This thing is almost as rad as a Transformer. Except that it is 7" and \*probably\* too under-powered to run Flash. It has killer battery life, so I will put this to use as an eReader. Not until I can maximize the performance...see if I can flash a ROM on this thing and overclock some stuff. Rooting and getting the Android Market will be the first step. Could be fun.
