In preparation for the impending shit-storm that will consist of me, a soldering iron, and dozens of small, fragile components, I decided to see if I can actually get my Arduino to talk to a servo. Well, it turns out that the code is not the issue. The built in servo library is pretty easy to tackle. A little bit of analogue, a little bit of digital, a little bit of shameless self promotion... \[caption id="attachment\_2539" align="aligncenter" width="550" caption="shameless plug"\][![sweep](/uploads/2010/08/arduino-sweep.jpg "arduino-sweep")](/uploads/2010/08/arduino-sweep.jpg)\[/caption\] \[caption id="attachment\_2538" align="aligncenter" width="550" caption="messy"\][![sweep](/uploads/2010/08/sweep-arduino1.jpg "sweep-arduino")](/uploads/2010/08/sweep-arduino1.jpg)\[/caption\] Step one...check. I can sweep through 180 degrees. Can I solder to save my ass (and semi-valuable electrical components)...time will tell. Also, I'm post dating this post. Happy B-Day Betsy.
