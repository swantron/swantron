Zig and I have been having some heated Words with Friends battles recently. I had to snap a screenshot of this ridiculous game status... \[caption id="attachment\_4292" align="aligncenter" width="480" caption="unacceptable? that shit's got ice, dude"\][![words with amigos](/uploads/2012/01/words-w-friends.png "words-w-friends")](https://swantron.com/wwf-royal-rumble/words-w-friends/)\[/caption\] It was bullshit that Ziggy wasn't awarded more points for playing his handle, and bullshit too that Europa wasn't an acceptable play. We both got over it. We are pretty evenly matched...I might be ahead by two games. Sad day in Mudville when I am addicted to a Zynga game...too bad the Scrabble app for Android was borderline unusable. Zynga would kill it, score-wise. Mental note.
