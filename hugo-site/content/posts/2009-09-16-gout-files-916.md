Kate and I went to all-you-can-eat-crab night at Looies last night...I'm 90% sure I overdid it. Not only from the standpoint of what is and is not socially acceptable to consume in a public setting, but more from the angle that I have gout, and this crap is horrible for my body. \[caption id="attachment\_966" align="aligncenter" width="495" caption="delicous little bastards"\]![delicous little bastards](/uploads/2009/09/crab.jpg "crab")\[/caption\] So right now, my bloodstream is the site of a strange battle between ibuprofen and acids trying their best to crystalize. My toe is about 5000 degrees, but pain-free thus far. Godspeed, brave ibuprofen. Godspeed.
