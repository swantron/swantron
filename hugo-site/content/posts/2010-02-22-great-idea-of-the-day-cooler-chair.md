[This stupid site](http://www.solutions.com/jump.jsp?itemID=15717&itemType=PRODUCT&path=1%2C3%2C474%2C10570&iProductID=15717) is selling a very non-stupid item...the cooler chair. \[caption id="attachment\_1739" align="aligncenter" width="604" caption="I bet it could hold about 30 OMLs"\][![](/uploads/2010/02/awesome-chair.png "awesome-chair")](/uploads/2010/02/awesome-chair.png)\[/caption\] Of course, the cooler access would be rendered more and more useless the emptier it gets...then again...that is when the sitting aspect of the product becomes more vital. Not sure where I am going with this thing; I'm confused. But I want one. Agh.
