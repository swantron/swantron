I was looking for some more Sugarhill Gang Apache video content for my sweet [MySpace profile](http://www.myspace.com/bouncerblog "Swanny's MySpace"), when I stumbled across this gem. Has anyone else noticed that bouncerblog has next to nothing to do with the Legion anymore? Griff gets punched in the head last week, Ken Marty and Bus get into an altercation regarding a big hat, and I keep throwing up retarded video posts. Something seems to be working...we ended up with 264 unique visitors in one twenty-four hour period and have crushed our previous monthly bests. Here you go teens. `<object height="350" width="425"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/eTKL8MNH95Q"></param><embed height="350" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/eTKL8MNH95Q" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425"></embed></object>`
