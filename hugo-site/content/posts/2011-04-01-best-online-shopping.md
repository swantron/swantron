As I am an expert on all things internet-y, it should come as no surprise that I am a proponent of online shopping. A staunch proponent, in fact. Don't get me wrong...I am all about grocery shopping. One of my dream jobs is to work in a butcher shop; maybe I can make that happen when I retire from this code stuff. If I ever hit the lottery, it will be a tough call as to whether or not I drop of an application at Orange Julius or the Meat Shop. Time will tell. Anyway, back to the topic at hand. Tracking down items online. It really isn't that hard. One of my daily rituals on the webs is to check the [deals at Savings.com](http://www.savings.com/m-Ghirardelli-coupons.html). For those not in the know, Savings is sort of a hybrid between Woot and Amazon. Good stuff. \[caption id="attachment\_3462" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="I need to spring for a better drawing setup"\][![saving money](/uploads/2011/05/saving-money.jpg "saving-money")](/uploads/2011/05/saving-money.jpg)\[/caption\] Instead of offering a limited deal of the day, a la woot, or a selection that is somewhat static, a la Amazon, Savings.com is an aggregate of deals from all over the place. Mothers Day flowers...you bet. JCP and Target...you also bet. The cool part of this is being able to associate a store's deal with what you need. Take my t-shirt wardrobe for instance. If J C Penny's is having 25 percent off of men's ware, I can snag those suckers for two bucks per unit. Not too bad, right. Hit that link up there to see what is available. Tell them Joe sent you.
