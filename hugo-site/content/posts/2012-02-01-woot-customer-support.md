Mr. Beer. That name again is Mr. Beer I bit on the Mr. Beer home-brewing kit last woot-off. Much to my dismay, the kit arrived in a giant brown cardboard box, with a sizable puncture would in the side. Opening it verified the damage: ![mr beer](/uploads/2012/02/mr_beer-570x319.jpg "mr_beer") The brewing container was smashed inward, and the plastic was too thick to pop back into shape. I tried contacting FedEx, as the damage was definitely done in shipping. As it turns out, after creating an account with FedEx | submitting a claim ticket | waiting | waiting, FedEx has you contact the sender when the item is shipped via "Smartpost." Whatever that entails. Not very helpful...just a reply email sending me back at woot. I was sort of pissy, and ended up forwarding the email from Fedex to the primary woot returns email. Details are as follow:
> I'm very sorry about that. We'll get a replacement sent to you and have our crack team of commandos that make the Expendables look like babies go after them. No need to return the damaged one to us.

We have received your request, however when packages are lost or damaged, only the party directly paying the shipping charges to FedEx SmartPost may file a claim. Please contact the Shipper with your information so they may file a claim. We apologize for any inconvenience. Thank you, FedEx SmartPost Customer Support ----- Original Message ----- From: Joseph Swanson <xxxxxxxxxx>Date: Tuesday, January 31, 2012 9:02 pm Subject: damaged shipment from woot To: SPCustomerSupport@fedex.com &gt; In regards to Smartpost tracking #02927009713120839115... &gt; &gt; I received a package from woot.com today (1/31) that was damaged by &gt; something en route to my front stairs, likely a forklift tine. &gt; &gt; I recognize that mistakes are made, accidents happen, etc., but it so &gt; happens that the damaged item is a Mr. Beer home-brew kit. The (assumed &gt; forklift) did quite a number on the brewing vessel in particular, and &gt; the &gt; plastic used is not well-suited for popping back into shape. The reduced &gt; volume caused by the damage render the vat unable to accommodate a full &gt; batch of beer, which is the end goal. It turns out that our baby daughter &gt; is angrier that first assumed...half batches may not cut it. &gt; &gt; Kind regards, &gt; &gt; J. Swanson &gt; </xxxxxxxxxx></xxxxxxxxxxx></spcustomersupport>
Awesome support, Woot. FedEx should take note. FedEx should also teach their forklift drivers how to drive forklifts, but that is another topic entirely. You will continue to receive my business...well done. I owe you a (Mr.) beer.
