Who doesn't like 3D? This ol' gal certainly does. Or did. ![](/uploads/2010/02/3D_glasses.jpg "3D_glasses") I don't get the last joke, but [Engadget](http://www.engadget.com/2010/02/10/ps3-getting-3d-firmware-update-this-summer/) reported the following: Get your active shutter glasses ready: your PS3 is going to go 3D this Summer. In conjunction with the release of its 3D BRAVIA LCD sets, Sony is planning to release updates to turn the PS3 both into a stereoscopic 3D gaming platform, in addition to a 3D Blu-ray compatible movie player. Sure, we knew Sony was planning to give us 3D sometime this year, but now that we've got a summer time frame we can plan our wardrobe decisions according -- jean cut-offs, here we come! I'll gladly wait for Visio to come out with a 3D LCD/LED, and kindly pay less than half of the price of a Bravia, thanks. Regardless, this is pretty sweet news.
