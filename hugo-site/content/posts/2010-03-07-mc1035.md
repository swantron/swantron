I'm on the fence with this one...the Mc10:35. \[caption id="attachment\_1766" align="aligncenter" width="340" caption="McWTF?"\][![McWTF?](/uploads/2010/03/mc-1035.jpg "mc-1035")](/uploads/2010/03/mc-1035.jpg)\[/caption\] To pull this one off, one needs to hit up McDuck's @ around the time that the elusive breakfast to lunch goes down...hence the name Mc10:35. Order a stale McMuffin from the back rack....order a McDouble...place egg &amp; bacon from McMuffin on McDouble...enjoy. Hopefully they have some defib pads in the dining area, because I'm pretty sure you are not making it out after that bad boy. Question of the day: do you go w/ french fries or hash browns with that? Or stick with the theme and smash both together?
