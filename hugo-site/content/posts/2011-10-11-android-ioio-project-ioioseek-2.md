I hope you don't mind, but I went ahead and stepped it up a few notches. My newest project brings my end-goal a few steps closer. I now have the pieces in place to put together an actual robotic implementation with the IOIO...since things have officially reached the cool stage, I decided to drop this as a stand-alone project. Complete with pics, a vid, and an app. IOIOSeek: ![IOIO android servo seek](/uploads/2011/10/IOIO-Android-Seek-570x320.jpg "IOIO-Android-Seek") What I have here are two slider bar controlled servos, an analog input-read solar panel, and some LEDs toggled via a button. The control is via the IOIO / Android. ![servos and solar panels on ioio android](/uploads/2011/10/Android-IOIO-Seek-570x320.jpg "Android-IOIO-Seek") The pictures, however nice, don't really tell the story. Take a look at the video to see this thing in action: <iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="416" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/elzgLYu-ngQ" width="570"></iframe>As the video alludes to, I am going to run with this concept. The automation (robotics) lies in the analog reading with respect to the servo positions. I plan to 'scan' the panel...that is the piece that is missing. Once I can implement that mess, I will have a tracking system. Implementations will fall out of that. ![analog input ioio](/uploads/2011/10/IOIO-Project-Seek-Android-570x320.jpg "IOIO-Project-Seek-Android") As with the last few projects, I have dumped [the app on the Android Market](https://market.android.com/details?id=swantron.project.seek) for general perusal. The app's description provides the details of the pin configuration, which is straight forward. I have two PWM outputs, a pure 3.3V digital toggle, and a pin configured for analog input. That is that. I will push my code to GitHub as well eventually, and provide a link therein. I still need to polish my generic servo code, since my latency was borderline awful in retrospect. Look for that in the near future as well. As always, drop any questions to joe\[at\]swantron\[dot\]com. Feel free to share your IOIO projects with me...
