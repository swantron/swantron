So, good news and bad news. Yin and Yang. I managed to get my open drain setup working with the IOIO. Ytai was right...just needed to dump more current through the sucker and pull 5V from the board. See below: \[caption id="attachment\_3755" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="pulling up to 5V"\][![pull up](/uploads/2011/08/Pull-up-resistor.jpg "Pull-up-resistor")](/uploads/2011/08/Pull-up-resistor.jpg)\[/caption\] On to the bad. I wasn't pushing enough current to trigger my 120V relay...but before I could do some current calculations, my piece of shit Radio Shack multimeter finally gave out. How timely? Not to worry...a quick trip to Lowes, and we have a new (much higher quality) Ideal DMM: \[caption id="attachment\_3754" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="+1 thermocouple"\][![ideal multimeter](/uploads/2011/08/Ideal-Multimeter.jpg "Ideal-Multimeter")](/uploads/2011/08/Ideal-Multimeter.jpg)\[/caption\] Your eyes aren't fooling you...that is a thermocouple. Thermocouple and stand...pretty official. I'll get some calculations done and figure out where we are with this guy...pretty close!
