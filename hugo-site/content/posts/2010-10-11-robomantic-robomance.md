In honor of the absolute worst national holiday, enjoy a Columbus-inspired robot picture: \[caption id="attachment\_2758" align="aligncenter" width="448" caption="brobotmance"\][![king of the world](/uploads/2010/10/king-of-the-world.jpg "king-of-the-world")](/uploads/2010/10/king-of-the-world.jpg)\[/caption\] See what I did there? Now, picture Leo drawing a nudie pic of a big-ass-diamond-wearing-robot. Robomantic....more like brobomantic.
