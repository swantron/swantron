Say hello to Champ! ![Champ the MSU Bobcat](/uploads/2006/02/MSU_mascot_champ.jpg)Whereas Monte, the University of Montana mascot, appears in the Sports Center headquarters from time to time, MSU's mascot Champ! has recently had a makeover to look more like Freemo. ![freemo.jpg](/uploads/2006/02/freemo.jpg)Watch out Big Sky Conference...its Champ! Apparently Champ! is into bouncerblog.com, as he is prepared for March Moustache Madness. Good looking out.
