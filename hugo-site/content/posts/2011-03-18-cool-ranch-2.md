That blue stuff is awesome. Imagine how amazing this would taste: \[caption id="attachment\_3267" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="oh cool"\][![invert](/uploads/2011/03/cool-blue-ranch.jpg "cool-blue-ranch")](/uploads/2011/03/cool-blue-ranch.jpg)\[/caption\] I bet it would destroy your taste buds.
