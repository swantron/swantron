I'm preparing to publish a project utilizing the new bluetooth library for the IOIO. I started horsing around with my IOIO Servo Controller application, and finally got frustrated with the lag that was existing between my slider bar and the servo. I never pulled my improved function from my IOIOSeek work over...it was overdo. Anyhow, I sort of cleaned house and put together an improved interface, and [pushed it to github](https://github.com/swantron/IOIO-Servo-Controller). ![push it](/uploads/2011/11/servo-project-570x413.png "servo-project") Here is a quick vid of the new app in action: <iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="375" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/gVGVMp9Ud3w" width="570"></iframe>I pushed a new apk to the [Android Market](https://market.android.com/details?id=swantron.project.servo&feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsInN3YW50cm9uLnByb2plY3Quc2Vydm8iXQ..) as well. If you have it installed, it should update in the morning. Here is a sneak peek of the updates: \*Optimized code to alleviate lag between slider bar and servo positions. \*Increased minimum version requirements, for future bluetooth connectivity \*Added function to keep slider in an inactive state until IOIO connection made \*Cleaned up code to remedy force close situations \*Remapped PWM pin from 5 to 10 for consistency with my other apps \*Removed text field of slider position / on board LED \*Simplified layout for smaller screens I pulled some function, but am more than willing to reintroduce the relative readout and/or on-board LED display. I am trying to go simple with this one, and ramp it up once I can figure out the lag that the bluetooth connection will introduce.
