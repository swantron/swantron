Well, I made some progress this weekend with respect to hardware, firmware, and bootloaders. My bluetooth IOIO implementation is still giving Eclipse shit-fits. I am seeing an error with the bluetooth library...it fails on compilation. Unfortunitely, I am running out of weekend, so will cut this one short and make a statement about the backend. In order to replace that pesky USB cord with a sleek virtual cord, aka a bluetooth connection, one must update not only the IOIO application, but also the IOIO bootloader. The application is easy enough to flash, but he bootloader requires a programmer for updating. Luckily, Ytai was kind enough to design a 'programmer by second board' option, and incorporate that into the same UI as he utilized for flashing apps to the board. The first step was off to SparkFun for a second IOIO. ![ioio android bootloader ](/uploads/2011/11/dual-ioio-android-570x296.jpg "dual-ioio-android") I kept the second bare bones, except for the pins I would need to do the actual programming. ![soldering stuff](/uploads/2011/11/soldering-stuff-570x309.jpg "soldering-stuff") The key was to have both boards up to date enough to function as programmer and target, so I first loaded the newest application versions to each board. The rest was a matter of utilizing the IOIO Manager app on the Android, and letting the programmer do its thing. ![two ioios](/uploads/2011/11/two-ioios-570x289.jpg "two-ioios") For reference, the setup was power to power, ground to ground, pins 37|38 to pins 37|38, and pin 36 to mclr...with mclr being on the target board. USB connected to the programmer board...that is that. Unfortunately, my IOIOSeek app ended up stroking out when I attempted to load the bluetooth library. It works fine with the newest general library version, so I know that my bootloader indeed was a success. Back to the Java drawing board before I can demonstrate the new feature.
