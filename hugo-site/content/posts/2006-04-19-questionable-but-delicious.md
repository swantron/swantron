This post is pretty much for John Swanson and Matt Zignego. Look what I found in my hand at the Legion. Sixteen delicious ounces... ![0418062354.jpg](/uploads/2006/04/0418062354.jpg)My favorite Old Style moments were in Wrigley a few years back. Go Cubs! My only other experience involved Ziggy, a hastily made "Fuck Wall Drug" sign, an overnight drive across the Midwest, and an upended chew spitter. Perhaps Zig's Mom's Meatloaf CD as well. Go Loaf! I was under the impression that the Rocky Mountain states were out of Old Style's territory. Maybe this is an omen that '06 will be all Cubby Bears.
