I spotted this dandy of a vehicle in the Home Depot parking lot this afternoon. I think we need to track the owner down for a photo-op. Picture Grif in this little pistol shooter. Ahh. ![stupid car](/uploads/2006/09/stupid-car-two.jpg)![another stupid car picture](/uploads/2006/09/stupid-car.jpg)![here is the stupid car again](/uploads/2006/09/stupid-car-three.jpg)With oil below $65 bucks a barrel, we are bound to see some cheaper fuel in the not to distant future. I hope gas prices drop just to spite this asshole...imagine crawling into this diminutive piece of shit every morning. Or better yet borrowing the parents effeminate lime green three wheeled car for the big date. Or trying to skirt Bozeman Pass in January...two wheel action...goin' huntin'?
