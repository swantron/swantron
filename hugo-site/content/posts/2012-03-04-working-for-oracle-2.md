Same title; different managment; same cube; different name on the virtual paystub. The M&amp;A is complete...I'm officially working for Oracle. Excitedly working, in fact. \[caption id="attachment\_4420" align="aligncenter" width="480" caption="oracle | right now"\][![working for oracle](/uploads/2012/03/oracle.jpg "oracle")](https://swantron.com/?attachment_id=4420)\[/caption\] I find it amuzing that my employer is holding the reigns of Java. I initially started doing Android dev half-ly out of curiosity, and half-ly for career protection / growth. Now I am testing dot netty stuff for the guys who win most enterprise contracts and prevent dot nettiness from occurring in the first place. Sort of crazy, in a good way. Cheers to new things...
