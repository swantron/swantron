Same title; different managment; same cube; different name on the virtual paystub. The M&amp;A is complete...I'm officially working for Oracle. Excitedly working, in fact. ![working for oracle](/uploads/2012/03/oracle.jpg "oracle") I find it amuzing that my employer is holding the reigns of Java. I initially started doing Android dev half-ly out of curiosity, and half-ly for career protection / growth. Now I am testing dot netty stuff for the guys who win most enterprise contracts and prevent dot nettiness from occurring in the first place. Sort of crazy, in a good way. Cheers to new things...
