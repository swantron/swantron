A while back, I collected my first Woot BOC. The prize crap in the bag of crap was, without any doubt, the radio controlled Batman helicopter. Great Scott... ![batman rc helicopter](/uploads/2011/06/batman-1.jpg "batman-1") Wrong movie catch phrase, right? Well, so too are the aerodynamics of a helicopter SHAPED LIKE BATMAN. She is not a very sky-worthy vessel. The rotors push air directly into the clear plastic tab connected to his booted feet...it is not stable at all. Time to tear it up. ![helicopter tear down](/uploads/2011/06/batman-2.jpg "batman-2") I figured that I could remove the obstructive plastic and have a machine that would function well enough to navigate around the garage-shop. I removed the guys legs, which were light enough to be approximated with a zip tie. As I had hoped, the new lower portion acted to dampen some of the erratic flight. ![black hawk up](/uploads/2011/06/batman-3.jpg "batman-3") It was stable enough to allow me to snap that picture...not a possibility with the unmodified original. Curiosity got the best of me, as it always tends to. I had to break this apart to see how it worked. I am sort of impressed I took the intermediate steps this time...most of my tear down sessions are done quickly and rabidly. ![batman guts](/uploads/2011/06/batman-4.jpg "batman-4") This was sort of impressive, actually. The foam chest cavity was hollow to allow for the constituent components...including the mechanical gears. Light, protective, and durable...the triple threat. It was, until I removed it completely... ![bare bones](/uploads/2011/06/batman-5.jpg "batman-5") There you have it...pretty basic design. Two variable motors, an IR receiver, a battery, a DC power jack, a switch, some caps and resisters, and a chip to run it. The IR sensor was hidden in Batman's utility belt. Great Scott that is clever. After all of that, this puppy still flies... ![flight worthy](/uploads/2011/06/batman-6.jpg "batman-6") I was pretty gun shy to let that rip. It took a couple of dives in my first two picture attempts, wrapping the battery cord around the rotor assembly. It still works...pretty tough little guy. Next step...I'm going to get into that controller. It acts as both the charging unit and IR sender, in addition to providing the variable control to the motors. It shall be awesome. Stay tuned.
