These rims are hotter than the combination cutting and grinding bit on my new cordless Dremel (after I've been cutting and grinding servo fittings with which to secure the rims in question.) ![chrome robot wheels](/uploads/2012/02/diy-robo.jpg "diy-robo") For a project that is being tackled in five-minute-sleeping-baby sessions, it is shaping up. I am not quite sure if the IOIO board will fit in the enclosure, but it will sure be close. I suppose if all else fails, I can chop the thing up a bit...as much as I enjoy Dremel-ing, I'd like to avoid that if possible. Maybe next five minute session...
