Happy Presidents Day. I like Taft...he was chubby. Two entertaining pics for your viewing pleasure: ![andy.jpg](/uploads/2007/02/andy.jpg)Andy was skewered looking for a knife. ![edward.jpg](/uploads/2007/02/edward.jpg)Pat playing a round of popular Washington drinking game "Edward 12oz Hands." Oofta Doofta...I am sure there are a few good shots from Josh and Mikey's place. B.O.Bizzle and Bouncer Ken put on an old fashioned shit show. Hopefully they will surface; I am off to read more about our twenty second president Chester Arthur.
