Flashback to 2010. A simpler time. I was finally abandoning my BlackBerry, which is basically one step above bag phone by today's standards. I was torn between two devices: the Motoroala X and the Motorola Droid 2. I opted for the physical keyboard, and have not looked back. Flash back to present. A time less simple. With Katie's iPhone 4S in the mail, it is nearing my turn to make a decision regarding my new device. The best phone on the market, in my book, is the Droid Razr. The kicker is the soon to be released Droid 4... \[caption id="attachment\_4195" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="...hmm"\][![moto droid 4](/uploads/2011/12/moto-droid-4.jpg "moto-droid-4")](https://swantron.com/droid-4-vs-droid-razr/moto-droid-4/)\[/caption\] This thing has the same stuff under the hood as the Razr, very, very similar to the duality between the Droid 2 and X. Trading .3 inches and AMOLED for a smaller qHD screen...sort of a tough call. But...the good news is that I have a few months left before I need to make the decision. My Christmas wishlist instead is one involving \[link redacted\] this year. I am a sucker for strange electronic devices...that should be apparent from the remote controlled clock. I'm hoping to pick up some hackable gizmos that I can chop apart, and leave the phone decision for another day.
