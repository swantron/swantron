Black Sox, for the win... ![swan tron dot baseball](/uploads/2011/08/bozeman-baseball1-648x1024.jpg "bozeman-baseball") 2011 Gallatin Valley Men's Adult Baseball League champions. You can't tell due to the backlighting, but there are four games worth or infield on that uni. Red Bull, ibuprofen, celebratory OMLs, Skoal, and infield. And grass from a couple of cans of corn put-outs. Happy and tired.
