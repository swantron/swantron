Q: Guess who is pretty dang pumped that he or she didn't drop some loot on a Drod Eros last week? A: This guy. This guy right here. This guy, married to Verizon. This guy, handcuffed to Verizon Wireless, and thus, pumped to see a sick-as-shit Android phone drop. This non-Motorola-liking guy, right here. HTC Incedible, in the house. \[caption id="attachment\_2018" align="aligncenter" width="468" caption="El HTC es Muy Incredible"\][![Incredible-HTC](/uploads/2010/04/Incredible-HTC.jpg "Incredible-HTC")](/uploads/2010/04/Incredible-HTC.jpg)\[/caption\] Upon initial reviews, this sucker is making the other Android suckaz look like clunky piecez of shit.
