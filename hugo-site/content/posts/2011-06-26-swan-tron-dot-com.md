Don't call it a comeback. Or a re-branding. \[caption id="attachment\_3604" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="+1 sort of new but mostly the same"\][![swan tron dot com](/uploads/2011/06/swan-tron-dot-com.jpg "swan-tron-dot-com")](/uploads/2011/06/swan-tron-dot-com.jpg)\[/caption\] You can't really re-brand something that lacks, in large, a brand. Let's just say, I'm dropping the ninja. The robot stays, but knows his place. Carry on.
