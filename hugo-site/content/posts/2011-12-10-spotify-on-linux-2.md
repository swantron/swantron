Hey nerds. Guess what? Spotify on Linux. Super easy too...fire up a terminal \[ctrl-alt-t\] Step one: **cd /etc/apt**Step two: **sudo vim sources.list**Step three: add "**deb http://repository.spotify.com stable non-free**" to the file ![spotify for linux](/uploads/2011/12/spotify-one-499x570.png "spotify one") Step four: **sudo apt-get update**![spotify linux ubuntu](/uploads/2011/12/spotify_linux-489x570.png "spotify_linux") Step five: **sudo apt-get install spotify-client-qt**![spotify on ubuntu](/uploads/2011/12/linux_spotify-570x356.png "linux_spotify") That is that. It is not a supported version, but I doubt anyone installing via aptitude will really care about that item. Side thought: How sad is it that my favorite album came out in 1993? Old balls.
