+1 doing Arduino proofs of concept at work on lunch break ![solar-y](/uploads/2011/02/solar-power.jpg "solar-power") I packed a solar cell and a little breadboard to work today...put together a little sketch together over my lunch break to control LED brightness with solar cell analog readings. I shot a little vid that I will toss on YouTube. Expect a full write-up soon. You suckers might even get a snippet...
