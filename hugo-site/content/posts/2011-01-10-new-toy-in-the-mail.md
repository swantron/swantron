I stumbled across this product, that I honestly had no idea existed. \[caption id="attachment\_3102" align="aligncenter" width="575" caption="from sparkfun"\][![excellent](/uploads/2011/01/powertail-575x421.jpg "powertail")](/uploads/2011/01/powertail.jpg)\[/caption\] It is pretty much an AC switch, that can be 'switched' via a 5V signal. Let me see...what do I have that can push 5V? ARDUINO, Y'ALL. My project scope is about to get greatly wider. Stay tuned.
