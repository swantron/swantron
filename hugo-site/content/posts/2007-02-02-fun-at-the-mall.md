I found myself at the mall this afternoon with some time to kill while waiting for a few bouncerblog.com shirts to be put together. An hour wait? Get real ShirtWorks. I found some entertaining things; J P has a whole line of cell phone antenna charms at the Verizon kiosk. Sgt. Tim enjoys chili and bread bowls. On to the pics. While enjoying a regular combo at Famous Wok (props on the name) I noticed this rock star food court pimpin. The poor burrito shop employee was taking some serious passes from an athletic chap from Foot Locker...bellied up to the ol' burrito bar. ~Tip: change, then spit game. ![amthalete.jpg](/uploads/2007/02/amthalete.jpg)Scene two. Tom Green and Andy Dick are two comedians that I absolutely fucking hate. Tom Green did have a skit on his short-lived MTV show that was hilarious, involving a megaphone and a woman dressed in purple. That popped into my head as a purple sweatshirt/sweatpants combo strolled past me...almost distracting me from the gentleman behind her, wearing a striking navy blue sweatshirt/sweatpants combo. ~"Just doin' a little shoppin'. In my sweats. I wonder if they sell sweats in this mall?" ![mathlete.jpg](/uploads/2007/02/mathlete.jpg)I love the mall.
