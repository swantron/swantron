New toy alert... ![android controlled ip webcam](/uploads/2012/03/ip-webcam.jpg "ip-webcam") The price of IP webcams has dropped to a pretty ridiculous level. My cheap little Foscam can handle audio and has eleven sweet little IR LEDs for nighttime footage...should have taken this route over the Samsung baby monitors, hindsight being what it is. I configured my router and have this cam connected to my home network wirelessly, so I can access via my router's URL, the local network, or via free apps on my Droid or Katie's iPhone. Sort of ridiculous. Full pan and tilt controls and the works. The further beauty of this IP dude is full hackable controls. In addition to the IR LEDs (eleven indicating a decent amount of juice) on this unit, there is a light meter, speaker, microphone, and two servos. All triggerable with this thing's API over WiFi. I just need to find some time...this thing is sweet.
