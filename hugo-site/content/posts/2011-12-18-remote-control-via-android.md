The motorized orange thing project is a wrap. Well, as wrapped as it will be for the time being...Katie is full term, so we are working on borrowed time. I managed to introduce remote control to the orange thing via Android and my IOIO board. I found a goofy motorized alarm clock, Clocky, on Woot a while ago. My first thought was something along the lines of 'that looks like a great thing to tear apart.' The unit is designed to make a lot of noise, and drop off the nightstand when the alarm is triggered...key features are its 'ruggedness' and two-wheel design. Pretty slick platform for horsing around with my IOIO. Once it arrived, I began ripping it apart: \[caption id="attachment\_4186" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="clocky's guts"\][![clocky's guts](/uploads/2011/12/clocky_testing-570x320.jpg "clocky_testing")](https://swantron.com/remote-control-via-android/clocky_testing/)\[/caption\] My focus points were fairly straight forward...keep the drive train system intact, and gain control of the motor function. The stock power was via four AAA batteries, so I did some testing with my 3.3V outputs on the IOIO: \[caption id="attachment\_4187" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="broken-out"\][![breakout to ioio](/uploads/2011/12/clocky_breakout-570x320.jpg "clocky_breakout")](https://swantron.com/remote-control-via-android/clocky_breakout/)\[/caption\] My 3.3V connections really made the unit crank. The on-board DC motors were fairly snappy...looked promising. I broke out the leads from the battery holder as well, figuring that I \*may be able to drive the IOIO with the 6V. That is when thing got sort of dicey...I could run over a hard connection, but the current needs of the board / bluetooth setup was too great for this application. I determined that I would need to introduce some technology, which ramped up the complexity of the build by a bit. Luckily, I had a Adafruit MotorSheild collecting dust on my bench. I scrapped one of the H-Bridge chips, and mounted it on a simple test board: \[caption id="attachment\_4188" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="wires galore"\][![wires and dev boards](/uploads/2011/12/clocky_more_testing-570x320.jpg "clocky_more_testing")](https://swantron.com/remote-control-via-android/clocky_more_testing/)\[/caption\] This approach worked. DC motors are power thirsty little bastards...keeping my power sources isolated was the key to getting everything running w/o issues. Basic setup became this mess: \[caption id="attachment\_4189" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="proof of concep"\][![android ioio](/uploads/2011/12/the_setup1-570x356.jpg "the_setup")](https://swantron.com/remote-control-via-android/the_setup-2/)\[/caption\] Zip ties, electrical tape, Altoids tin, some swearing, etc. later... \[caption id="attachment\_4190" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="fugly project is fugly"\][![ioio project finihed](/uploads/2011/12/IOIO_project_finished-570x320.jpg "IOIO_project_finished")](https://swantron.com/remote-control-via-android/ioio_project_finished/)\[/caption\] ...weird orange thing is ready to roll. Check the video: <iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="386" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/ZNQsiZ8WioA" width="569"></iframe>Down the road, I would like to turn orange thing into a mobile mount for the phone itself. The end-goal of this whole bizarre project would be to have a web-controlled vehicle with on-board video streaming. I need to do some research and figure out how to mash around the video feed...going to have to step the Java game up a few notches. That takes time, and spare time is not abundant...it could happen though. I will dump this code on GitHub and throw the apk on the Android Market. Stay tuned.
