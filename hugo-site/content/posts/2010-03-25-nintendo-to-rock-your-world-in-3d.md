Unfortunately, said world from the title is the world in the palm of your hands. Long story short, the DS is going to drop some sweet glasses-free 3D on yall suckaz. ![dot awesome](/uploads/2010/03/dsi.jpg "dsi") But don't take my word from it... TFA from [PCW](http://www.pcworld.com/article/192145/will_anyone_buy_a_3d_nintendo_ds.html):
> Imagine picking up a Nintendo DS and playing games in 3D without the clunky, dork-tastic glasses. Nintendo says a handheld gaming device that'll do just that will launch in Japan before the end of March 2011, and that it'll reveal its so-called "Nintendo 3DS" to the world for the first time at E3 2010 this summer. But wait--3D without the funky eyewear? How does that work? Like those tricky picture perception puzzles, where you have to "relax" your eyes to see the mathematically embedded 3D picture? Or like the laser heads-up-displays that project an imagine onto your retina? Or how about actual head jacks, like the metal prongs plunged through occipital bones in The Matrix?

Matrix reference in aught-10. Poorly played, PC World. They continue... > Speculation aside, let's assume Nintendo's got the 3D part down pat, and that it'll be at least as persuasive as the technology in the video above. The real question's this: Will gamers buy a so-called "Nintendo 3DS" on the merits of 3D alone? Ask that question in a broader sense, "Is anyone really interested in 3D?" and the answer's "No one knows." The technology's all hype and punditry to date, a public relations push by technology vendors eager to sell pricey versions of existing view-screen technology with a slight visual twist.
Whatever, naysayers. 3D is awesome, and since it is Nintendo, it will be incredibly playable, and it will sell very well. Without any doubt. I'm looking forward to it.
