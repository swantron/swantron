This is courtesy of the [Bozeman Daily Chronicle](http://bozemandailychronicle.com/ "Chronicle"). I hope this is a sign that they re-hired the old police report author...these things used to be hilarious. **"Two men on West College Street were pushing each other and yelling. Officers stopped them. They said they were really good friends and that their method of communication was normal in their home country."**Where are these dudes from? I want to visit. My favorite of all time was the report that a bear was "cited" outside of town. I hope they provided the bear legal counsel.
