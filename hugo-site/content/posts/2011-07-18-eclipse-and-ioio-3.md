Five Volts are so 2010. I'm all over this three and three-tenths Volts stuff. \[caption id="attachment\_3692" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="here we go"\][![3.3 volts ioio arduino sketches](/uploads/2011/07/ioio-eclipse.jpg "ioio-eclipse")](/uploads/2011/07/ioio-eclipse.jpg)\[/caption\] Don't call it a comeback. I blew the dust off of my IOIO board, and am ready to do some 3.3V stuffs. I have already deduced that my PowerSwitch Tail won't relay at 3.3V, but will make a switching noise and fire the on-board LED. Lesson learned. I guess I had better get serious with my EE...this is a circuitry step up from the Arduino without a doubt. Expect a project and some code soon. I am going to make something work.
