My conversion from DC motors to continuous drive servos is going to be a little more involved than first assumed. The idea is to keep the speaker, upgrade the drive-train, and re-purpose some buttons for power and possible function modes. Oh, and perhaps the toughest item...enclosing the IOIO itself...without nuking the bluetooth function. Here goes nothing... ![ioio enclosure teardown](/uploads/2012/02/clocky-teardown-570x319.jpg "clocky-teardown") It became quite clear that I need to gear up before proceeding. ![hot glue gun and dremel from amazon](/uploads/2012/02/hgg-570x229.png "hgg") Shipped and on the way...hoping to get a chance this weekend to get my grind (and glue) on.
