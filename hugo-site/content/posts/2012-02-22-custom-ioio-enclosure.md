My conversion from DC motors to continuous drive servos is going to be a little more involved than first assumed. The idea is to keep the speaker, upgrade the drive-train, and re-purpose some buttons for power and possible function modes. Oh, and perhaps the toughest item...enclosing the IOIO itself...without nuking the bluetooth function. Here goes nothing... \[caption id="attachment\_4402" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="guts"\][![ioio enclosure teardown](/uploads/2012/02/clocky-teardown-570x319.jpg "clocky-teardown")](https://swantron.com/custom-ioio-enclosure/clocky-teardown/)\[/caption\] It became quite clear that I need to gear up before proceeding. \[caption id="attachment\_4403" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="primero"\][![hot glue gun and dremel from amazon](/uploads/2012/02/hgg-570x229.png "hgg")](https://swantron.com/custom-ioio-enclosure/hgg/)\[/caption\] Shipped and on the way...hoping to get a chance this weekend to get my grind (and glue) on.
