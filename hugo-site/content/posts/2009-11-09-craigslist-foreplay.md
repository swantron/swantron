[![mulie](/uploads/2009/11/mulie.bmp "mulie")](/uploads/2009/11/mulie.bmp)Alright...this one is sort of confusing. From what I can gather, Duncan Gilchrist's daughter is using craigslist to fondly rib Bruce, who apparently has a history of writing bad checks. One thing is clear...Duncan Gilchrist does not like the looks of mule deer. The post is unclear as to whether or not Duncan Gilchrist finds other game animals adorable.
