The iPad doesn't multi-task The iPad is less powerful than my Mini 9 The iPad is twice as expensive as my Mini 9 The iPad still requires tethering sans WiFi The iPad is Flash-free The iPad... ![gay](/uploads/2010/01/Ipadhand.jpg "Ipadhand") ...ups the iTunes bullshit ante with some asinine iBooks bullshit. Dealbreaker. Honestly, this thing is basically an entry level netbook with a touch-screen and a whole grip of proprietary junk. No HDMI out, so you cannot use your glorified e-book reader as a portable media center. No thanks. Maybe once this thing is jail-broken it will be worth a look, but as the iPad sits in Gen I, this thing is going the way of the Macbook Air...straight to obscurity. The Apple fanboiz should be all over this stupid thing. I'll stick to the smartphone / netbook for the time being.
