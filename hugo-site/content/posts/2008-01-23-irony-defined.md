The Swantron family is headed to sunny Mexico for our first family get-together in a decade here in two weeks. In preparation for my trip, I decided to pick up a fresh new pair of Adidas Shell-toes. Overstock.com...white on white...free shipping...sign me up. This is what showed up: ![Mexico Kicks](/uploads/2008/01/mexico.jpg)LOLercoaster. I'm rocking them...hopefully with a sombrero.
