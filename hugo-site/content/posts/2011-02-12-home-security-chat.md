When I think [security system](http://www.homesecuritysystems.com/), my brain immediately jumps to a webcam. More specifically, a webcam and a couple of servo motors. Most specifically, a webcam, a couple of servo motors, and a slick web interface with which to drive said servos and see a live stream of said webcam. I'm getting closer to making that a reality. Bear with me. Here is the 20,000 dollar question: what happens when I see something awry? \[caption id="attachment\_3160" align="aligncenter" width="500" caption="\*~freezing~\*"\][![freeze](/uploads/2011/02/sec_cam.jpg "sec_cam")](/uploads/2011/02/sec_cam.jpg)\[/caption\] I could take and save footage all day, but then what? I'll assume that everyone has seen advertisements for ADT...they have the missing piece in the puzzle I laid out. Monitored alarm system...I can throw together a system to capture, but do not have the time to do the monitoring. I think I would sleep better, having someone on the other end of the line. ADT is, without a doubt, the best to have on the other end. I would love to spend some time with one of their systems...they have a lot going on. Pet insensitive sensors? Yep. How do they do that? Must be one hell of an algorithm that goes into that infra-red sensor. Positioning and triggering would be very cool to tear into. Wireless keypads...ditto. Not sure how they keep that secure. I'll wrap this up. Check into home security, for sure, and more specifically into ADT. Go with the best.
