Brian Schweitzer's bolo-tied-up smarmy ass just gained a level of respect in Swaniachi's book. I hate partisan politics somewhat less than I hate blind belief sets...draw your own opinion. [Guvnah' Schweitzah'](http://news.aol.com/elections/story/_a/montana-governor-calls-out-a-creationist/20061009131309990001?ncid=NWS00010000000001)Chalk one up to logic. Keep in mind that even though his figures were vague, Brian does hold a masters degree in soil science from MSU. Roger Koopman is a ultra-conservative thirty year local hack politician who doesn't trust the Internet and its "hate blogs." Fuck you anyway, Roger. I do like how the show of hands came into play...not enough shows of hands anymore.
