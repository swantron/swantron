Making progress...2D graphics are far easier than I would have expected. \[caption id="attachment\_3109" align="aligncenter" width="402" caption="poor man\\'s crossword"\][![sudo ku](/uploads/2011/01/sudocu1-402x575.jpg "sudocu")](/uploads/2011/01/sudocu1.jpg)\[/caption\] Next up: figure out how to animate and add sound. Bonus: figure out why I am dumping hours into sudoku...not a fan. Good exercise, bad game.
