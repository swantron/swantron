Quantum Levitation is all over the webs. It is way easier to find videos than it is to find explanations...it all boils down to this: ![quantum trapping](/uploads/2011/10/quantum-levitation-570x316.png "quantum-levitation") You may want to kill the sound for the video...pretty obnoxious. <iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="300" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/VyOtIsnG71U" width="525"></iframe>As speculated, the main thing in play is the fact that at areas of the superconducting material that are not uniform, (defects) flux tubes exist as the material is cooled to extreme temperatures. These tubes act to 'pin' the item, with respect to the permanent field. Physics rules. I really need to track down some liquid nitrogen.
