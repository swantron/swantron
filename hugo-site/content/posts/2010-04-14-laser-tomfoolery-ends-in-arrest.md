[This CBS affiliate ](http://cbs3.com/local/Camden.Laser.Light.2.1630942.html)is reporting that the man arrested a mini-van owner for a little green laser hyjinx. Hyjinx? Hijinks? Hyjynx? Not sure, but tallk about some injustice... ![tomfoolery](/uploads/2010/04/laser.jpg "laser") FTA: > On the ground, a Camden police unit responded to the corner of Alabama Road and Congress Road and located Villalobos sitting inside a **red Dodge minivan**. Police approached Villalobos, who admitted to being the person flashing the laser light at the helicopter, saying that he thought it had been a news helicopter. The laser pointer light was located inside the glove compartment box of the vehicle.
The question remains, Did this guy... a) Own said mini-van b) Borrow his wife's mini-van, or c) Borrow his mom's mini-van I'm going with c. It seems like a really "live at home in the basement" thing to do...
