My usual 8 hour Pandora session at work was replaced today with an 8 plus hour NPR session. \[caption id="attachment\_2671" align="aligncenter" width="550" caption="I feel infringed upon"\][![green droid](/uploads/2010/09/green-droid.jpg "green-droid")](/uploads/2010/09/green-droid.jpg)\[/caption\] Yep, even NPR has an app for Android. Move the eff over iPhone...this sucker is gunning for you.
