It would be pretty unlikely, given my history blogging and working in the software development field, that I would not be a computer guy. Quite unlikely, and utterly false, for the record. I too am a huge fan of forensics. Kate and I have nearly worn out our old CRT TV upstairs in the bedroom watching Forensic Files on TrueTV. Can't get enough of crime fighting science nerds. Saving the day with technology...pretty much my dream job. Combine those observations, and it is a natural assumption that I would be all about [Computer Forensics](http://www.computerforensic.com), and that would also be a valid inference. Maybe someday, I can use my mad skills to serve the purpose of expert witness in a sweet cyber crime...until then, I'll be cranking out oddly-filtered images using the Gimp: ![investigator](/uploads/2010/06/investigator.jpg "investigator") Remember the story from a month or so ago about the data exposure linked to printer hard drives shipped to China? Case in point...e-discovery is a huge concern currently. I'll admit it, I had never thought twice about 'what happens when you send a document to print' until that hit the media. Even though the print jobs are not visible after a time on the printer itself, anyone with half a brain would think that said info could be retrieved. This is the realm of computer forensics professionals...yank that drive and get to work...all completely retrievable, until the drive is juiced and files need to be overwritten. Case in point, make no assumptions regarding what is assumed to be secure. I stumbled upon Elluma Discovery while checking into the field a bit. They are computer forensics specialists...providing expert witnesses in e-discovery all over the place. How all over the place? The examiners in question have testified in State and Federal Courts, at arbitrations, mediations, and depositions. I'm jealous. I just use my skills to make sure lenders give credit where appropriate. If I end up in court in my current position, I have done something grossly wrong. Grossly. Maybe Elluma is hiring...I could mix my computer skills with my firearms skills. Concealed carrying forensics tech? FOR THE WIN, SON.
