I am not often confused with a Sureno, but apparently I was last night. Nothing like fighting your way into a gang in a basement bar... Fortunately, I rolled into the only [Norteño](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norte%C3%B1os) unable to dispatch an ass-whoopin on a 165 pound homeboy with a bunch of math tats. Score: XIV neck tatto, 0 110010110 bicep tatto, 0 Draw.
