<style sally-struthers-voice=""> Do you enjoy saving money?  Sure.  We all do. </style></head><body>When was the last time you heard that name...Sally Struthers. Wow. The message holds true, though. We do all enjoy saving money. Well, the internet has made comparison shopping easier than ever before...and [Billy.com](http://www.billy.com) has made internet-based savings easier than even that. \[caption id="attachment\_2511" align="aligncenter" width="550" caption="got my mind on my money and my money on my mind"\][![money](/uploads/2010/08/robot-money.jpg "robot-money")](/uploads/2010/08/robot-money.jpg)\[/caption\] Let's take a look at one timely scenario. As I posted a while ago, Sweet Lou Pinella is retiring as the Cubs manager at the end of the 2010 baseball season. There is no doubt that he will move back to his hometown of Tampa Bay, where he managed before taking the position with the Cubs. What will Lou do, specifically? Step one: locate [local moving services](http://www.billy.com/movers/local-long-distance/). Billy.com can do that. No sweat. In fact, Billy can help Lou out even further. How, you ask? Boom. [Tampa moving companies](http://www.billy.com/movers/tampa/) are there too, spelled out in a more specific nature. I'm sad to see Lou go, but glad that he can save some money on his move. It would be pretty unfortunate to see the old guy moving his own stuff, and I'm sure he will be able to track down a veritable company via Billy.com.
