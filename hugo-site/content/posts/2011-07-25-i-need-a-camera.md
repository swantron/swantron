I need either a camera, or a backup Android for dev. I'm shooting for the later. For real though...cash for a used Droid X. Anyone know of a good [marketplace](http://www.zaarly.com/ "marketplace") to pick a used one up? I'll entertain offers at joe\[at\]swantron\[dot\]com. You know you want an iPhone... Here is the motivation: \[caption id="attachment\_3699" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="messy lab is messy "\][![i need a camera](/uploads/2011/07/ineedacamera.jpg "ineedacamera")](/uploads/2011/07/ineedacamera.jpg)\[/caption\] I had to swing the laptop around to snap a picture of my Monday-Funday effort for this week. I need to snap (shoot maybe?) a video of my IOIO work, but I find myself in want of a micro SD card. Both of my 2GB cards are at the office, and my IOIO Android app is sitting happily on my Droid 2's memory card. For the loss. Loss like the Droid X's battery tendencies. Really, get rid of that phone. It is awful...I will be doing you a favor by taking it off of your hands. The screen is too big...hard to fit in your pocket, etc. Cash. I'll get a vid up tomorrow. Fear not.
