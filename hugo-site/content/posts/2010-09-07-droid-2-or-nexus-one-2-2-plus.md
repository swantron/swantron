The proof is in the pudding (or in the froyo?) on this guy. Droid 2, hands down. Sorry Nexus fans. I ran a benchmark test on my Droid 2 running Froyo. Here are the results, in slick, colorful, sideways bar graph form. ![droid2](/uploads/2010/09/droid-picture.jpg "droid-picture") Sorry for the awful picture quality...I had to log into my dual boot, in order to use Dell Webcam Central (garbage) to snap a picture of my phone. Turns out, my phone is also my camera, and I have yet to grab a screenshot app. Whatever. I'll summarize the results. Droid 2 with Froyo ------ 1384 units Nexus One 2.2 --------------------- fewer unit than 1384 Others Played -------------------- far fewer units than even 1384 Not sure what these units are, really, but the Droid 2 is clearly superior. I used an app called Quadrant, which is alleged to be quite legit. It surprised me that the Droid X is lagging behind 2.2+ that much...it was supposed to be hotter than Hades. The Samsung Galaxy S is making a solid case for itself, sitting well above the Nexus One and HTC Desire. As for those on the Moto Droid...hang in there. Hopefully you can manage to break your phone under warranty and get something with the Snapdragon under the hood. \*\*\*\*Bonus Bloggage...after I snapped the above picture and put together this post, I knuckled up on the Widowmaker pictured in the background. My knuckles indicate that I once again lost.\*\*\*\*
