While checking out Wii titles at WalMart today, I stumbled across an older gentleman rocking out to Guitar Hero in the aisle. Funny enough. Our Guitar Hero hero finished his song (Styx?) and gave the game a "aww...come on" after receiving his ranking. At this point I assumed him to be blog-worthy and snapped a quick picture. ![guitar hero](/uploads/2008/06/guitar-hero.jpg)At this point, I realized that maybe a video would be better.

In the short time it took me to get my phone ready the guitar hero had already picked up a groupie.
