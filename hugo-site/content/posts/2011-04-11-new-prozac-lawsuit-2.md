It seems like the interwebs is full of info regarding a [prozac lawsuit](http://www.prozaclawsuit2011.com) of some sort. If you don't believe me, let Google auto-complete "Prozac Lawsu.." and see for yourself...sites are popping up like whack-a-mole moles. Spoiler: they pop up incessantly. Pause for Prozac-bot: ![prozacic brobot](/uploads/2011/04/prozac.jpg "prozac") So, what's up with that? Birth defects. That is what is up with that. There has been a recall of certain antidepressants and anti-seizure drugs, of which Prozac has been included. Joking aside, some of these things, when taken by women during pregnancy may cause increased risks of serious congenital birth defects, heart defects, spina bifida, club feet, and even cleft palates. Scary stuff. If you fit the bill, hit that link at the top of this post. Good luck.
