This is pretty amazing. [robotic roach](http://www.vimeo.com/clip=8249 "robot")Essentially what you are looking at is a cockroach with its antennae sliced off and replaced with a set of neural stimulators. These are triggered by means of photo receptors, stimulated by different series of LED combinations. In reaction to the lights the roach moves the platform front or back and left or right by walking on the trackball. This whole mess becomes a robot with a living component. Weird stuff. So this might be your fossil fuel alternative, Biddy. Maybe your grandkid's grandkids will be "driving" genetically souped up ostriches outfitted with brain interfaces...I don't know. Maybe your grandkid's grandkids will buy second hand emus for their highshool aged kids with which they can back into other emus in parking lots. ![kukaracha.jpg](/uploads/2006/01/kukaracha.jpg)
