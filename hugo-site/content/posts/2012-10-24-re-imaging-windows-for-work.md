The Bozeman Oracle branch doesn't have desktop support. As luck has it, I am a talented enough sleuth to troubleshoot Windows issues. Me: "I have a virus that has infected a library used by IE. McAfee isn't picking it up, and I can't find any remedies online." Me: "Did you try rebooting?" Me: "Yes. Several times." Me: "From the Control Panel, you can disable Windows features. Disable IE and use an alternate browser." Me: "The product I develop requires IE for installations." Me: "Curious. Re-image your machine." See...no need for the middle man. \[caption id="attachment\_4766" align="alignnone" width="1000"\][![windows re imaging](/uploads/2012/10/windows_dev_image.jpg "windows_dev_image")](https://swantron.com/re-imaging-windows-for-work/windows_dev_image/) (hourglass)\[/caption\] I haven't horsed around with a Windows install for ages...getting a nice sense of nostalgia.
