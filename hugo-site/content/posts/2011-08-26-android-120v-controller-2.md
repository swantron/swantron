It was worth the wait...I now control 120V via my Android. ![ioio android powerswitch tail 120V FTW](/uploads/2011/08/ioio-project.jpg "ioio-project") I had a mostly sleepless night, again. I managed to figure out what I had been botching while trying to provide enough juice to my PowerSwitch Tail. Transistors and alligator clamps are out; extra pins are in. Take a look at the (awful quality) video...on the main page, as the picture quality won't grind loading to a halt. <iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="349" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/S34scKXwtEs?hl=en&fs=1" width="425"></iframe>I still need to toss some headers on the IOIO, and take some clips out of the picture for a better picture of what I did here. Look for that shortly, along with a snippet. Pretty straight forward, but we'll have to see where this one ends up.
