It has been a busy several days. I decided to upgrade the fleet to Ubuntu 13.4...and everything that a non-long-term-supported distro involves. Step 1\_: backup data Step 1a: reevaluate backup regimine Step 1b: realize backup system is non-sustainable Step 1c: implement cloud storage solution step 1d: place eggs in cloud basket Step 2\_: upgrade machines Step 3\_: fix a whole bunch of junk Step 3\*: junk fixing Step three got ugly. Canonical blacklisted a whole bunch of stuff that ran and runs well. Thumbs down. ![post storm calm](/uploads/2013/06/quiet-lab.jpg) The upgrades to my machines were simple, but significant issues arose in updating from 12.04 to 12.10 and from 12.10 to 13.4. The former was mainly in 'not compiling video card drivers' and the later was primarily pertaining to neglecting Dell's primary Wi-Fi drivers. I went manual and had boxes that were mostly functional, but decided to roll the dice on fresh installs...which, predictably, worked well. That gut feeling in doing something of that nature is very Window-y, and I don't like it one bit. In short, poorly played by Ubuntu. It might be time to get some real QA going on these upgrades...I spent enough time researching this stuff to be upset, and I debug issues similar to this professionally. There was a ton of noise on forums, so it is safe to assume the user base was significantly disheartened by this process. On the flip side, 13.04 is slick...Unity is improved a ton...all of that. The marketing is not cool, and I'd be better off with pure Debian if this wasn't one of my hobbies. Worst upgrade of all time, but still something I look forward to and will likely do again. D+
