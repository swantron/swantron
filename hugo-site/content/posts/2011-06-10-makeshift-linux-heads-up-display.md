Per my last post, I began upgrading my Dell Mini 9 last night...from Ubuntu 10.10 to 11.04. Well, at some point, it tossed a fit about not being able to snag a package, and hung on a dialogue box all night. No worries...I'll finish this install on the way to work. ![ubuntu linux netbook on my silverado dashboard](/uploads/2011/06/mobile-ubuntu.jpg "mobile-ubuntu") Who said netbooks are passe? Looks like that guy was designed to ride on the dash of a Silverado if you ask me. For the record, I was not doing 110 MPH by the MSU campus. I have an issue with my speedometer. I was doing 90 MPH, tops. My install was a success for the record. I will see if all functions are fully functional soon, and put together a post.
