As promised, behold the much-anticipated footage of my Arduino AC Interface proof of concept. It was dark in my 'lab,' so the footage leaves something to be desired. <object height="370" width="575"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/dbNF0k64A_Q&hl=en_US&feature=player_embedded&version=3"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always"></param><embed allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" height="370" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/dbNF0k64A_Q&hl=en_US&feature=player_embedded&version=3" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="575"></embed></object>So, if anyone is in need of a strobe light, hit me up. I'm all over that. Stay tuned...I am working on the web-side of the Android dev kit, so hopefully I will have another test coming soon. Ethernet shield, Android, Arduino, and 120V...I'm getting giddy.
