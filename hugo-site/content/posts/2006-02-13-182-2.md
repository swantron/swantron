So, I have been curious about a bumper sticker I happened to see (on a Geo) a few days ago. Green lettering on a white background: "Oh no, not another learning experience." Am I missing something? I understand what a learning experience is, and I suppose I could see why that would be *somewhat* dreadful...but sereously. What is going on here? I am just curious who thought that insightful or funny enough to broadcast to other motorists. Maybe I need to brush up on my adages, but I am stuck wondering who would be rifling through bumper stickers, find that dandy, and decide that it would look nice on the ass end of his/her hatchback. Any feedback would be appreciated.
