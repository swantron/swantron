Greetings from 4800 feet above sea level...the ever-lovely Bozeman, Montana. Bad news to everyone to the right side of the Rockies: we are sending more water your way. Bozeman Creek is starting to hop some banks. ![bozeman creek](/uploads/2011/05/montana-creek.jpg "montana-creek") I jumped on the CT-90 after work and headed out to survey the situation. These pics were taken in Bozeman proper...on Church street North of Kagy. ![bozeman flood](/uploads/2011/05/bozeman-creek.jpg "bozeman-creek") There have been some road closures further North, as the stream has been running over a few roadways. Coincidentally, both major breaches have been near culverts...one under Mendenhall and one under Kagy. Poor planning, city engineers. A few hundred yards down the road from the bridge, I popped into my sister's old condo complex. I have seen some sandbagging there in the past. ![bozeman creek sandbag effort](/uploads/2011/05/montana-sandbag.jpg "montana-sandbag") A for effort, guys. Take the grade into consideration next time. This thing is slated to crest next week....we'll see what happens. Strange year for extreme weather, to say the least.
