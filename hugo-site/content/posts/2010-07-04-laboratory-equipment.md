I think what I fondly refer to as my laboratory might not classify as a true lab, per se. I have some sweet stuff going for me in my garage workspace...but the lack of [lab equipment](http://www.labplanet.com) might leave me with more of a nerd fortress, and less of a lab. Here is a quick pic: ![workshop](/uploads/2010/07/work-shop.jpg "work-shop") While most of my projects are electronic in nature, I still get down and dirty with some mechanical projects. Woodworking, too, and of course programming. I would for sure benefit from a [laboratory apparatus](http://www.labplanet.com/laboratory-apparatus.html) or two, in order to establish some lab credibility. Those above links are to Lab Planet...which I stumbled across while looking for some equipment. I was looking into a dry ice machine, which they have, and saw that they have scores of sweet equipment. Centrifuges, microscopes, furnaces...even mass spec stuff. How sweet would my Arduino projects be with a touch of chemistry?
