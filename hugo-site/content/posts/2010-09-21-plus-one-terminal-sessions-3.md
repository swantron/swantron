I'd like to post the details of my latest one-on-one with my Arduino...but, I'm not going to. \[caption id="attachment\_2688" align="aligncenter" width="550" caption="twinsies"\][![dual](/uploads/2010/09/dual-terminal-sessions.jpg "dual-terminal-sessions")](/uploads/2010/09/dual-terminal-sessions.jpg)\[/caption\] Suffice to say, it was sweet. Anything (non work related) involving multiple command lines is plus one awesome.
