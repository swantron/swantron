I can finally report a conclusion of sorts on the IOIO / PowerSwitch Tail project. The 'of sorts' disclaimer is in regards to my Android App, which is pretty much a working beta. I have some issues with my onResume code, and want to put some polish on the UI. That said, I have released the code to the interwebs, so had better provide a write-up. The setup is the same as I have been posting. Dual open drain pins with a 10K pull to 5V do the lifting...triggering of pins is handled via my IOIO board...Android app providing a UI to do the switching. ![ioio-example-project](/uploads/2011/09/ioio-example.jpg "ioio-example") I went ahead and published my app on the Android Market. It will pop for sure by searching for IOIO. ![android market app](/uploads/2011/09/android-market-570x351.png "android-market") Price: free ninety nine. Can't beat that. I also tossed this code up on GitHub. Go nuts. ![github example](/uploads/2011/09/github-570x394.png "github") Video time: see this in action. <iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="345" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/iQ_Bonhnt4Y" width="420"></iframe>Basically, between all of the shaky camera work, I download my app from the Android Market, connect via USB, and control the 120V relay via my Droid 2. I will shoot a better video once I clean up my code a bit. Stay tuned. The README on GitHub and the app details section should have all of the connection information. I can provide any further details via email / comments / @swantron. Have fun with this one...
