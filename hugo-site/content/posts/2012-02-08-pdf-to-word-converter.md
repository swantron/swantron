PDF files have all sorts of great implementations. When security is a concern, it is pretty much a standard in the software industry to go with PDF...as much as I love a plain text file, sometimes they just don't cut it. External facing documentations? Think PDF. The downside of the standard comes in the conversion factor. Doing business on different levels undoubtedly will end up with different departments using different file types. Standardizing via pdf will end up involving pulling a full gambit of extensions into the desired form. It can get messy. I recently stumbled across a solution that I am glad to see exists...namely, a [pdf to word converter](http://www.quick-pdf.com/pdf-to-word.htm). No joke...it took me by surprise to see that it is easily handled. ![pdf to word converter](/uploads/2012/02/pdf_to_word-570x434.png "pdf_to_word") Quick-PDF (as the name implies) provides a solution that can do PDF to Word Converter easily. I have struggled in the past to find a way to drop PDFs into .doc files, .rtf files, etc. on Windows machines. Not anymore. They have even worked in a command line mode...which, needless to say, really pleases a \*nix guy like me. High quality to boot. I'm a big fan. I'm glad to report that I will no longer be maintaining my docs in multiple formats. +1 efficient.
