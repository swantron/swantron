As a dude who makes his living in the software-as-a-solution CRM software world, I appreciate the subtleties of [Application Hosting](http://www.computersupport.com/application-hosting.html) when it is done right. I am in SaaS engineering, or as every "tech" reporter likes to spew, cloud-based services. It is what it is...and often times it is helpful. One good thing about the whole notion is the upside of not dealing, physically with servers... ![24 7 it support](/uploads/2011/11/24-7-IT-support-570x397.png "24-7-IT-support") Hosting, [IT support](http://www.computersupport.com), consulting, troubleshooting, guaranteed uptime...the whole thing becomes a mess when you are attempting to serve basic business needs. Serve some pages, offer some interfaces, transact. It all adds complexity by the bucket-load when taken from a concept to an implementation. There are serious gains to be had with [cloud hosting](http://www.computersupport.com/application-hosting.html)...take that complexity off of your books. To the cloud!!!! ComputerSupport.com does what its name implies...namely offer computer support. Instead of paying a team to maintain your back-end, you focus on your interface design and workflows, and let them mash out the details. Guaranteed, and supported. Best of both worlds.
