Time for my insurance rant of the week. Another rainy Saturday, another afternoon spent trolling for better insurance. This time: Life Insurance! ![dead robot](/uploads/2010/06/dead-robot.jpg "dead-robot") I managed to find some pretty slick stuff at LifeInsuranceStar. Not only the normal [Life Insurance Quotes](http://www.lifeinsurancestar.com), but they had a huge range of reviews and articles, ranking the [Best Life Insurance Companies](http://www.lifeinsurancestar.com/lifeinsurance/company-ratings.php). Trust me, it is not easy to find this type of info in a concise format. Check out Geico...ranks pretty high for life insurance. ![geico](/uploads/2010/06/geico.png "geico") I spent some time checking out the [Annuity](http://www.freeannuityrates.com) information. The site itself is slick...made it easy to get wrapped up in my research.
