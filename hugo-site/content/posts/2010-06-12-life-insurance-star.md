Time for my insurance rant of the week. Another rainy Saturday, another afternoon spent trolling for better insurance. This time: Life Insurance! \[caption id="attachment\_2299" align="aligncenter" width="550" caption="deados"\][![dead robot](/uploads/2010/06/dead-robot.jpg "dead-robot")](/uploads/2010/06/dead-robot.jpg)\[/caption\] I managed to find some pretty slick stuff at LifeInsuranceStar. Not only the normal [Life Insurance Quotes](http://www.lifeinsurancestar.com), but they had a huge range of reviews and articles, ranking the [Best Life Insurance Companies](http://www.lifeinsurancestar.com/lifeinsurance/company-ratings.php). Trust me, it is not easy to find this type of info in a concise format. Check out Geico...ranks pretty high for life insurance. \[caption id="attachment\_2297" align="aligncenter" width="649" caption="A++ for the win"\][![geico](/uploads/2010/06/geico.png "geico")](/uploads/2010/06/geico.png)\[/caption\] I spent some time checking out the [Annuity](http://www.freeannuityrates.com) information. The site itself is slick...made it easy to get wrapped up in my research.
