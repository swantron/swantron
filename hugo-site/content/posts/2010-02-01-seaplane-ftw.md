I think Richard Branson is awesome. He basically does whatever he wants. Like [inventing seaplanes](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-1246972/Underwater-plane-bought-Sir-Richard-Branson.html). ![sera-plane](/uploads/2010/02/sea-plane.jpg "sea-plane") FTA: *Billionaire Sir Richard Branson may already own an airline, a record label, a mobile phone company, several luxury restaurants and a Caribbean island. But today the entrepreneur unveiled his latest toy - an underwater plane. The £415,000 prototype submersible is called the Necker Nymph and can dive to depths of up to 130ft. Sir Richard hopes to one day explore depths of 35,000ft - which is far more than the height of Mount Everest.*My hero.
