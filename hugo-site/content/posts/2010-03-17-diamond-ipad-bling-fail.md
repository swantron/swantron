And here I stand, thinking that Apple fanboiz were at the pinnacle of pretentiousness...turns out there is a far worse type of consumer: ![diamond-ipad](/uploads/2010/03/diamond-ipad.jpg "diamond-ipad") I think there is a joke to be made about polishing a turd, but I don't think this particular turd is polished. Maybe if they made it multitask or run Flash...however, this is what some dipshits at Mervis Diamond have done:
> This gorgeous diamond studded iPad features 11.43 carats of diamonds, hand-set in a micro-pave styling. The diamonds are graded G/H in color and VS2/SI1 in clarity. Price tag: $19,999. Very limited quantities available. Orders will be available June 1..
Good luck with that. I'm holding out for an emerald-studded iPhone. *Not.* Like that? Bringing back the not.
