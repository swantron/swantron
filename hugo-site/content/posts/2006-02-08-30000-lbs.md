I bet your average CET student could tell you that a cubic yard of crushed rock weighs roughly a ton. ![pile21.jpg](/uploads/2006/02/pile21.jpg)Well there are approximately fifteen yards of the junk right there. ![pile11.jpg](/uploads/2006/02/pile11.jpg)I think that is about 30,000 pounds Dave and I spread by hand. Studying remedial math would beat the hell out of this type of work.
