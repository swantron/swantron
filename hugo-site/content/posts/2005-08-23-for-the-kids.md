Well. I feel bad :( about the crass content of that last post. Let us all loosen up a bit. Are you ready kids??? ![](http://www.bouncerblog.com/wp-content/photo_0008.jpg) :) Heyyy!!!! :)It's Louie Anderson! :)What a funny dude?!!! ;)Do you kids like roulette??? I took this photo early in the morning after losing quite a sum of money on the roulette table in Las Vegas a while back. Unfortunatly, I was not able to meet Louie in person. :(
