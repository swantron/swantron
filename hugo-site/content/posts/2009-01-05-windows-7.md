So Windows 7 leaked a few days ago...why not? Between Kate and I, we have four Dell laptops in the house: ![](/uploads/2009/01/computers.jpg)I figure it would round things out to convert my old 9300 to Windows 7. Grif is always down for a nerd project, and he is currently smoking me in our downloading competition. I'm going to try to transfer tomorrow (with a serious lack of RAM) and will keep you posted.
