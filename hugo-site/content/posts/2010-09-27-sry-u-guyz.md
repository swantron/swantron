srsly sry srsly sry to the point of making an apologetic, aggressive, lightening-bolts-out-the-ass, image to show my deep, deep regret for my laziness. \[caption id="attachment\_2695" align="aligncenter" width="550" caption="+ several aggressive"\][![pew pew pew crack snap pew](/uploads/2010/09/bitchin-cool.jpg "bitchin-cool")](/uploads/2010/09/bitchin-cool.jpg)\[/caption\] I realized that I have approximately nine posts sitting in my figurative TO DO box. Including the much anticipated stuff regarding [soldering the Arduino Motor Shield](https://swantron.com/arduino-motor-shield/). Much anticipated may be a gross overstatement. It will be there, and we can judge at that point. Srsly.
