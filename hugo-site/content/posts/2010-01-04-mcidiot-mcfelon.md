> JANUARY 4--Meet Melodi Dushane. Angered that Chicken McNuggets were not available at an Ohio McDonald's, the Toledo woman allegedly put her fist through the eatery's drive-thru window. The January 1 McNuggets rage incident resulted in Dushane, 24, being arrested for felony vandalism and booked into the Lucas County jail, where the below mug shot was snapped. A Toledo Police Department report does not indicate why the McNuggets were not available Friday for purchase by Dushane, who has been ordered to stay away from the Main Street McDonald's... ...Last March, a Florida woman was arrested after she called 911 three times to complain that a McDonald's was out of Chicken McNuggets. "This is an emergency. If I would have known they didn't have McNuggets, I wouldn't have given my money, and now she wants to give me a McDouble, but I don't want one," Latreasa Goodman told a police operator.

 Here's a big Hi-C cheers to Melodi, who's white-trashy-ass name truly fits her white-trashy-ass crime.
