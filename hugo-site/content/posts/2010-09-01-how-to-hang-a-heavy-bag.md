This is not a chipper tale of how-to boastery. Far from it. I cartoonified the shit out of the following pics, in order to further convey the surreal darkness that was involved in this seemingly trivial task. Buckle up...it is not likely to be pleasant blog-reading. The mission objective was simple enough: hang a heavy bag. The mission-turns-out-to-be-a-little-cooler-and-a-little-more-involved moment came when I realized there was approximately one punching bag length between the ceiling in my garage and the spot where I wanted the top of said bag. I'll let the pictures tell the story, for the most part. My knuckles are all sorts of funked up, which is an indication of the title's eventual success. Or aptness. Or giant fail...I'm still very confused. Enough rambling...first thing I know, I'm standing on my Honda Trail 90, wondering how I ended up with a heavy bag (and Honda Trail 90) before I managed to end up with a goddamned ladder. ![boo](/uploads/2010/09/worst-ladder-ever.jpg "worst-ladder-ever") When in Rome...snap a pic. It's pretty much all about the photo-documentation at this point. ![smoove criminal](/uploads/2010/09/smoove-criminal.jpg "smoove-criminal") "Uh" is incredibly right. That sucker was bouncing around looking down...not so stable when my arm and or both arms were above my head. Good thing I'm limber. Huh? My grand idea involved two threaded rings. Innocent enough looking... ![oh, nice](/uploads/2010/09/oo-hook.jpg "oo-hook") ...fucking **wrong**. Far from innocent, when said threaded ring is dropped into spider-central... ![darkest hell](/uploads/2010/09/darkest-helll.jpg "darkest-helll") Well, I managed to knock most of those webs out of place with my trusty framing hammer. Unfortunately, I knocked them right on that stupid shiny thing I was attemping to arm-fish out of the hole between the particle board, studs, spider poop, drywall, and **darkest hell**. I got the stupid thing, did the weird shudder thing with my shoulders/neck for a half-minute, and got back into gear. Survival mode at this point. Darkest-hell-been-and-back-survival mode. Either my creeped out spider dance brought me luck, or my engineering was sound. Or both...but it worked out, against most odds. ![up](/uploads/2010/09/heavy-bag-up.jpg "heavy-bag-up") ![down](/uploads/2010/09/heavy-bag-down.jpg "heavy-bag-down") It works, and there is a box of delicious OML in the frame. So I guess I'll count that as a win???
