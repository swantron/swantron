I grew up approximately 920 miles from the Pacific Ocean. The border between Low-Earth-Orbit and Mid-Earth-Orbit is right around 1240 miles. It is safe to say that I was closer to the ISS or MIR than I was to an Ocean. This might help to explain my eerie attraction to anything oceanic...Oceanic 815 included. Lost, FTW! Needless to say, I jumped on the opportunity to shed some light about Hawaii Photo Rental's newly launched [Maui Camera](http://www.hawaiicamera.com/maui-camera.aspx) Store. Why not? Make a few bucks for some camera research...sign me up. Plus, it gives me the opportunity to superimpose the creepy sexy robot-lady in a beautiful aquatic setting... ![hang 10](/uploads/2010/02/robot-surfer.jpg "robot-surfer") First, a bit of geography...Maui is the Valley Island...the second largest of the bunch. As the nickname alludes, there are some serious valleys in Maui...puts the valley shots from Lost (on Oahu) to shame. Volcanos? Check. Mountains? You bet. Waterfalls? Better believe it. Space Science? Oddly enough, yes. The Haleakala Observatory is over 10,000 feet above the sea on a dormant volcano...awesome. Check the view... ![Haleakala](/uploads/2010/02/Haleakala.jpg "Haleakala") Obviously, Maui Camera is the place to go for all photography supplies above sea level. What about said supplies below and equally at sea level? They have you covered there, too. In order to take photos like the one above, you will need to pick up a [Camera Water Housing](http://www.hawaiicamera.com/waterhousings/spl.aspx), unless you wish to render your camera useless. Observe: ![solid](/uploads/2010/02/waterhousing.jpg "waterhousing") Maui cameras, Maui lenses, lighting, light meters...you name it, Maui Camera is your spot. For something that will be used once, why buy if you can rent? They offer reservations...hit a link to find out more. I'm pretty pumped after putting that together. Maybe we can save up some loot and honeymoon to Maui...space science and snorkeling...my kind of trip.
