Pushing code to the phone, FTW! I managed to throw together a quick Hello World using the Android SDK, configure a FroYo emulator, and drop the code to my Droid 2. Not a bad little Saturday, really. Screen shot from the emulator... ![hi](/uploads/2011/01/world_hello.jpg "world_hello") Webcam snap of code on phone... ![oh hey](/uploads/2011/01/hellp_droid.jpg "hellp_droid") So it begins. Stay tuned for snippets.
