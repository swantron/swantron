The only thing I've been doing pertaining to the site has been to polish off the resume and get a new job. That sort of stuff. I did run around the Gallatin Valley last weekend...chasing D-Rock and his gigantor ATV. 1000 cc...seriously. I really like the northern part of the valley: \[caption id="attachment\_4845" align="alignnone" width="1000"\][![atv four wheel bozeman](/uploads/2013/02/atv_bozeman.jpg)](https://swantron.com/gallatin-valley-four-wheeling/atv_bozeman/) which was lovely\[/caption\] Nice little Saturday. More to come about the job...I'll post some details when I start.
