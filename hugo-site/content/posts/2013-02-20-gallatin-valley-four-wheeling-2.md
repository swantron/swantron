The only thing I've been doing pertaining to the site has been to polish off the resume and get a new job. That sort of stuff. I did run around the Gallatin Valley last weekend...chasing D-Rock and his gigantor ATV. 1000 cc...seriously. I really like the northern part of the valley: ![atv four wheel bozeman](/uploads/2013/02/atv_bozeman.jpg) Nice little Saturday. More to come about the job...I'll post some details when I start.
