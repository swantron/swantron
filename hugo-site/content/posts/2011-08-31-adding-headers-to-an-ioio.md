Q. Am I dragging my feet with the whole IOIO code cleanup deal? A. Take a look at this little pictorial dealio regarding soldering headers to my IOIO Exhb 1: ![IOIO headers](/uploads/2011/08/baad-lab.jpg "baad-lab") Exhb 2: ![headers in place on IOIO](/uploads/2011/08/baaaaad-lab.jpg "baaaaad-lab") Exhb 3: ![powered IOIO](/uploads/2011/08/baaad-lab.jpg "baaad-lab") I'll get on that; you have my word. I am toying around with the idea of tossing the open drain app on both github and the Android Market, in order to throw some chum out to the crew of IOIO owners. We'll see.
