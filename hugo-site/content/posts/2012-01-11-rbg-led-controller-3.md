My off-the-cuff remark about building an auxiliary bilirubin light manifested itself into a quick project. In order to approximate the specific color of the bilirubin lamp, I figured that I would need to provide a means of setting PWM values for the three inputs. I had hard-coded values in Arduino code in the past, so thought about taking that route initially. I blew the dust off my Duemillova, fired up the Arduino IDE, and promptly decided to modify my Java servo PWM code to do the job. Sort of growing attached to the IOIO...sorry Arduino. So, the controller was born...IOIORBG. \[caption id="attachment\_4275" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="RBG ...
