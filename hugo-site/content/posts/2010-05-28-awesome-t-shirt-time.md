My little sister is pretty funny. Long story short, I bought a suit for my upcoming wedding. Elizabeth's response was "You bought a black suit? Wow. You never have to shop for clothes again." You know what? She is pretty much right. I replied "Yep...that about does it. I guess I can pick up some Levis and wifeys every now and then, and that is that." Awesome. Aside from that, I have an urge to grab a [custom tshirt](http://www.cafepress.com) every now and then. Like my "I'm Hungary for Turkey" tee...classy. Out of curiosity, I ended up trolling around to see if there were any good Lost shirts on the webs. It turns out I need to check out stuff of this nature more often. There are all sorts of amazing products that I have been oblivious to. There is a whole world of [Eclipse merchandise](http://shop.cafepress.com/twilight) that I found. Check this guy... \[caption id="attachment\_2219" align="aligncenter" width="530" caption="I beg to differ"\][![eclipse](/uploads/2010/05/men-twilight.jpg "men-twilight")](/uploads/2010/05/men-twilight.jpg)\[/caption\] Bold claim. I'm not sure that is 100% accurate. I saw this while browsing some [FIFA t-shirts](http://shop.cafepress.com/fifa)\[caption id="attachment\_2221" align="aligncenter" width="530" caption="no hands? what?"\][![no hands](/uploads/2010/05/futbol-math.jpg "futbol-math")](/uploads/2010/05/futbol-math.jpg)\[/caption\] Always a sucker for math-based humor, I thought that was pretty clever. On to the Lost stuff, the original focus of my search. I guess I'm a little nostalgic, but remember the countdown clock from season two? How much more awesome were the early days of the series than the last two seasons? Good times. Check this out: \[caption id="attachment\_2220" align="aligncenter" width="530" caption="4-8-15-16-23-42, yo"\][![epicness](/uploads/2010/05/lost-fail.jpg "lost-fail")](/uploads/2010/05/lost-fail.jpg)\[/caption\] This was also available in t-shirt form, but I though the detail on the plaque was better. And for the record, Desmondo's failure to enter the code was an epic fail. I might have to get that shirt in the mail. Or the Twilight shirt...imagine walking into a biker bar with that bad boy on. And then ordering a whisky, neat. Or a Mike's Hard Lime.
