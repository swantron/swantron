I walked into my designated printer room at work today to find the paper cutter broken. What a tragedy, right? I have absolutely no idea why we need a paper cutter, let alone several paper cutters, at our software shop FWIW. Regardless, I took it upon myself to remedy the problem. Sleep tight, thy co-workers...rest assured that you can again transform 8.5" x 11" paper sheets into 8.25" x 11" paper sheets, thanks to my pro bono paper cutter fixing skills. Observe. **What You'll Need:**\*Broken Paper Cutter \*Tape (Scotch) **Steps:**1) Locate Point of Failure You can see that this particular cutter has malfunctioned due to a broken cutting arm. ![paper cutter](/uploads/2010/05/papercutter1.jpg "papercutter1") 2) Procure a section of tape *(If you are unsure with what to do with the tape at this point, don't worry...this will come into play in step 3)*![paper cutter](/uploads/2010/05/papercutter2.jpg "papercutter2") 3) Place tape section on the displaced cutting arm ![fix](/uploads/2010/05/papercutter3.jpg "papercutter3") 4) Place displaced cutting arm on cutting arm articulating housing; secure tape ![paper cutter](/uploads/2010/05/papercutter4.jpg "papercutter4") That's that. Leave it in the printer room for the next idiot who actually uses a paper cutter...I bet bewilderment will ensue
