After seeing some terrible craigslist entries over the past few months, I decided to do a little experiment. Observe: ![cholula](/uploads/2009/05/screenshot1.jpg)So I assumed this would get flagged as a joke...not the case. Thus far, I have received the following emails: ![](/uploads/2009/05/screenshot.jpg)and ![](/uploads/2009/05/screenshot3.jpg)and my absolute favorite... ![](/uploads/2009/05/screenshot2.jpg)Good looking out, Ryan.
