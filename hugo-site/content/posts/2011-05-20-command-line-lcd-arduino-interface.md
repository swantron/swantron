Liquid crystal displays are pretty awesome. Command line interfaces are very awesome. Hmm... I started daydreaming at work about how to go about making hardware interface with an RSS feed. I have seen some projects that use Arduinos with ethernet shields to check Twitter, for example, but they seem unnecessarily bulky. Or clumsy. I spend a lot of time working on the command line, and love to put together dirty little scripts to solve problems. It sort of goes along the lines of 'when you have a hammer, everything looks like a nail'...I figured that the same thing could be implemented with a little shell scripting and my trusty Arduino, sans anything complicated. So far, so good. \[caption id="attachment\_3503" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="bad lab mobile"\][![bad lab mobile](/uploads/2011/05/LCD-setup.jpg "LCD-setup")](/uploads/2011/05/LCD-setup.jpg)\[/caption\] I put together a sketch (after the bump) to drive my LCD, writing serial output to the screen. After verifying that the sketch worked via the Arduino IDE's serial monitor, I popped open a CLI and got to work. FWIW, I am using Ubuntu 11.04 still...ctrl-alt-t pops open a terminal window...unity has me all over shortcuts these days. Anyhow, I was able to verify that I could echo text and direct it to the USB port that the Arduino was mounted to. No sweat. As a proof of concept, I decided to display the number of times that I had the word "awesome" on swantron.com. Once the LCD was shown to work, the sky is the limit...see some regex, pipes, wget, and so forth in action: \[caption id="attachment\_3505" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="CLI FTW"\][![CLI](/uploads/2011/05/LCD.jpg "LCD")](/uploads/2011/05/LCD.jpg)\[/caption\] Survey says: \[caption id="attachment\_3504" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="+11 awesome"\][![+1 awesome](/uploads/2011/05/awesome-count.jpg "awesome-count")](/uploads/2011/05/awesome-count.jpg)\[/caption\] Eleven "awesome"s. Awesome. (Hit the bump for some code, an oddity, and more fun...)
