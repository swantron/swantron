I really wish I had a boat. There is not much that fills me with a sense of Americana than seeing an old wooden boat flying the Stars and Stripes. I'm not certain what it is about [US Flags](http://www.united-states-flag.com) on boats, but it is pretty awesome. To a lesser degree, I take great pride in seeing [American Flags](http://www.united-states-flag.com/outdoorflags.html) on front porches. The good old Red White and Blue almost chokes me up...so too (to a lesser extent) do [car flags](http://www.united-states-flag.com/carflags.html), but that is a topic for later discussion. ![nice](/uploads/2010/06/independance-day.jpg "independance-day") I'd love nothing more, than to be out on Fort Peck or Canyon Ferry on a boat of some nature, cruising along with a flag cracking in the breeze. I could easily afford a Jet Ski, but the whole flag effect would be diminished. Maybe jury rig a car flag onto the handle bars of an old stand-up machine...doesn't really have the same effect or street credibility as you can exude if you are a boat owner. Our plans for this Fourth are still yet undecided. You had better believe that I will have a flag next to the Bell camper, and a cooler full of tasty OML. Maybe a few hot dogs...if there is room.
