Well, Netflix streaming is finally coming to the Wii. In one fell swoop, there goes one of my two reasons for getting a PS3. ![](/uploads/2010/01/Wii-Netflix.jpg "Wii-Netflix") Live streaming will hit Nintendo's console this spring, according to a today's joint announcement between the two companies. The setup will be nearly identical to that of the PS3, with a free disc available from Netflix needed to stream...no additional charges, however. I'm not sure how the Wii will compare to the PS3, since it's 720 output seems like a stretch. I do like some HDMI...not really excited to fire up the RCAs again. I'll give it a shot when it drops.
