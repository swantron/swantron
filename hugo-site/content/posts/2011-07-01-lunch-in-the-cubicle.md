Still dining finely on fancy lunches in the cubicle. This week's installment...three gourmet burgers. ![nom nom nom burgers nom](/uploads/2011/07/three-burgers.jpg "three-burgers") I find three to be the ideal number of main entree items at the office. ------------------------------------------------------------------ Unit 1, consumed at 10:00 AM, acts to lessen the coffee shakes. Unit 2, consumed around noon, acts to kill the smells of coworkers' lunches Unit 3, consumed at 2:00 PM, pretty much just food show-boating at this point +1 food show-boating
