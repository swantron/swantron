I've been a BlackBerry fanboi for quite a while. With my Pearl nearing the end of it's life...the question becomes Sexxy Storm... [![storm](/uploads/2009/12/storm-300x175.jpg "storm")](/uploads/2009/12/storm.jpg)Or Dirty Droid [![droid](/uploads/2009/12/droid-300x279.jpg "droid")](/uploads/2009/12/droid.jpg)I originally assumed it would be a no-brain victory for the Storm 2 and it's improved function over Gen 1. Since I don't use BB Messenger, I have lately been thinking the the $199 Droid might be the way to go. I have put my RIM phones through hell in the past, and definitely like that aspect over anything I have seen from Motorola. I basically just need something with a good enough OS to not lock up Pandora and Opera Mini...not sure that the Droid is what I totally need right now. Vote: If I was making the move today...it would be for the Storm. Not a big fan of the Google team right now, and RIM has been very good to me.
