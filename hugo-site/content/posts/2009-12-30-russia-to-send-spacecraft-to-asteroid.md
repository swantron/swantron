In a move that sounds a whole lot like the plot of Armageddon, Russia's space chief has announced his agency will consider sending a spacecraft to a large asteroid to knock it off its path in order to prevent a possible collision with Earth. Sweet. \[caption id="attachment\_1286" align="alignleft" width="723" caption="soyuz...the launch vehicle"\]![bang...zoom...to the asteroid](/uploads/2009/12/soyuz-723x1024.jpg "soyuz")\[/caption\] At least it is comforting to know that a simple slug will do the job, and no nuclear bombs are needed. I have money on them botching this job. Am I just bitter that my undergrad satelitte exploded at launch over the former USSR??? Maybe.
