First off...I am still unable to locate the correct driver to get my (new) wireless adapter up and running. Don't hold your breath, but I may soon be blasting around town with a big ass dipole antenna on my roof [wardriving](http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/wardriving "God, I am going to be awesome"). Put that shit on a geek test. Secondly, and perhaps more entertaining to most, I have uploaded some photos to my facebook account. You can check them out w/out logging in here. [Jamaica Photos.](http://montana.facebook.com/album.php?aid=2010875&l=42362&id=43807011 "facebook") Grif and I have been spitballing ideas regarding our photo gallery, so this is a quick fix of sorts. Enjoy.
