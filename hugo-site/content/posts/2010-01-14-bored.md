Bored? Well, you *could* sit around with your bowl haircut and feel sorry for yourself... ![](/uploads/2010/01/bored_students.jpg "bored_students") ...or alternatively, you could do something awesome. Mac user? You guys have it made. My favorite thing about Vista, maybe, was the fact they pre-loaded mahjong...Mac users, check out these [mahjong games for mac](http://www.macgames.fm/mahjong.htm). If you prefer to kick it old school (think Apple 2GS old school), give [spider solitaire for mac](http://www.macgamesandmore.com/simplysolitaire.html) a shot. Fun times will ensue. Of course, music is always an option...namely [royalty free music](http://www.audiobank.fm) over at audiobank. Hit the link to check out some tunes...legally for once, you criminals. If those suckers don't work, you can always look at that kid ^ some more. He is amusing.
