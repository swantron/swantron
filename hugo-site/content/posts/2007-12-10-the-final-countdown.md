I challenge you to tell me the most ridiculous aspect of this clip. <object height="355" width="325"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/bqPerJvXPVQ&rel=1"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed height="355" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/bqPerJvXPVQ&rel=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="325" wmode="transparent"></embed></object>There is a lot of shit going down on set...horrible over-singing, aggressive unnecessary title, dual keyboard action, puzzling hand gestures, a retarded song from the band Europe, models backing their thangs up, and I am pretty sure that is Joey Fatone striking a disco pose. Needless to say, I love it
