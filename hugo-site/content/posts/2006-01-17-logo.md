 I have been throwing around ideas to replace out banner for some time...trial one. My Photoshop skills are notably less refined than Drew's seem to be, but I got very close to what I was set out to create. Kyle and I have some code to figure out, and I may have to throw in a watermarked image after all, but there you go. New header beta version 1.1.
