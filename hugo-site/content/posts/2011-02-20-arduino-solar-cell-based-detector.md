\*Proof of Concept Warning\*-\*Proof of Concept Warning\*-\*Proof of Concept Warning\* Mission: Utilize a solar cell to vary the intensity of an LED Supplies: Arduino Duemilanove &lt;--&gt; USB &lt;--&gt; Notebook (Linux, por supuesto) Breadboard, Jumper Wires, Make-shift Jumper Wires (spare resisters), LEDs, Solar Cell Setup: Here it is ![work at work](/uploads/2011/02/work_at_work.jpg "work_at_work") The setup is pretty straight forward: Read analog, write digital. The primary hurdle was figuring out the initialization step. Basically, I needed to provide a time-frame where you can read in minimum / maximum values from the cell. The LEDs in the awesome video below show the results... v <object style="height: 390px; width: 540px"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/J3iNr4ERH64?version=3"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowScriptAccess" value="always"></param><embed allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" height="390" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/J3iNr4ERH64?version=3" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="540"></embed></object>This project is full of take-off ideas. Reverse the range on the LED outputs, and you have a setup that powers up a light as the ambient light levels fall. Motion detector...you bet. You could implement a setup to run the initialization cycle at intervals, to provide a real-time average light level, and check for a delta of some size. Boom. There you go. I'll clean up the code, use some real jumpers, horse around with things in general, and throw up a post. With a snippet. Check back.
