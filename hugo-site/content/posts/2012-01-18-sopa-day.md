I stumbled upon a SOPA protest last night...I first thought Wikipedia had jumped the gun, but realized it was after midnight on the Eastern side of things. ![entropy](/uploads/2012/01/sopa-320x570.png "sopa") Elsewhere for some entropy info...which will show up shortly in a post. Anyhow, this morning I found some [good info on the reddit blog](http://blog.reddit.com/2012/01/technical-examination-of-sopa-and.html "reddit blog") that concisely runs through some technical details of SOPA and PROTECT IP. Take a look...it is important.
