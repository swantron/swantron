I love lasers. I love weapons. I REALLY LOVE LASER WEAPONS! \[caption id="attachment\_1372" align="aligncenter" width="500" caption="pew pew pew "\]![me eyez](/uploads/2010/01/laser.jpg "laser")\[/caption\] U.S. Military...FTW! The latest addition to the arsenal is that bad boy pictured above. Optimus Prime laser, it is not. It is more closely related to the physics professor laser pointer, but way cooler. Like blind a dude from 2.5 miles cooler. Though it's intended use is to act as a deterrent, I have money on the blinding thing. It is unlikely that the optical scope's limitations would allow the user to keep that thing out of the target's eyes 100%, and with a laser intensity high enough to produce a range like that, blindness would surely ensue. The only thing better than laser-weaponry would be laser-computer-weaponry. Slap a \*nix netbook on that sucker...guaranteed I would have one preordered. It would look something like this... \[caption id="attachment\_1374" align="aligncenter" width="500" caption="much better"\]![horrible](/uploads/2010/01/laser2.jpg "laser2")\[/caption\]
