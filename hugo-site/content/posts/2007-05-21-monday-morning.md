Voy, (Boyd Freemo) Charles, (Chizzlah) and I attempted to plant some trees this rainy morning. Two of these were thirteen-foot spruce trees, with root balls the size of VW buses. "That tree is the size of two quite tall hippies, with a root ball the size of a vehicle that I would assume them to drive." ...something to that extent; I am not feeling very clever today. On to the clip. <object height="250" width="225"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/cb7Bbtg-mqQ"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed height="250" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/cb7Bbtg-mqQ" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="225" wmode="transparent"></embed></object>You could not see the mischievous grin that Chuck had while attempting to pilot the skid-steer up the hill and sliding immediately backward. You too could not see the inevitable hitting of the t post by the sideways Bobcat. Great way to start the week.
