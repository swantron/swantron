Oh boy oh boy oh Hoy... As luck would have it, Bozeman Deaconess Hospital's finest could not adequately diagnose when enough is enough regarding seizure medication. Example: ![paul-wall.jpg](/uploads/2007/02/paul-wall.jpg)Our Boy Hoy received a clear bill of health four weeks preceding an unheard of three seizure day. Three fractured verts and a mashed up tongue to boot! Awesome! I am not a litigious guy, but this might be worth a look. Abbster...since Wednesday you just jumped three hundred points in my make believe log. For reals though.
