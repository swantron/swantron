I created a Google+ account last week, in order to kick the tires a bit. I am going to hold off on a full review until I get some circles going, test the [group video chat](http://www.linqto.com/ "group video chat") functions, etc. I do want to mention one puzzling feature that Google has built into this thing. Instant upload. I don't get it. \[caption id="attachment\_3686" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="plus one google plus"\][![google plus instant upload](/uploads/2011/07/google-plus-570x427.jpg "google-plus")](/uploads/2011/07/google-plus.jpg)\[/caption\] This makes for super easy uploading of images to your profile. Android phone...cellular radio connection...there you go. This app will run a cron job to dump your photos to your Google plus profile. The default setting is to allow this when you set up the Google+ Android app, with all new photos dumped to a private (non-shared) folder on your G+ account. I opened up my settings and let this one rip. \[caption id="attachment\_3687" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="plus one intrusive"\][![webcam shot to google plus via android](/uploads/2011/07/instant-upload.jpg "instant-upload")](/uploads/2011/07/instant-upload.jpg)\[/caption\] It took about 20 seconds for that picture to show up in my private folder. Cool implementation, but pretty impractical. *Issues I have with this:***\* Increased data usage. Especially as unlimited plans are goners. \* Battery nukage. One more thing to kill -9. \* Location data. Real time seeding a DB with your lat/long. \* Duplicate media. Primarily for deletions...two is worse than one. \* Neccessary? USB cord...bluetooth...MMS...physical media...email...**Suffice to say, I will have this 'feature' disabled. Stay tuned for the full review, and holler if you would like an invite.
