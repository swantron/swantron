A while back, I put together a project that added [remote control via an Android](https://swantron.com/remote-control-via-android/ "swantron"). I broke out the leads to the DC motors that were existent, and left the structure largely intact...resulting in a monster of a build. ![ioio remote](/uploads/2012/02/ioio_remote-570x283.jpg "ioio_remote") I would like to clean the build up a bit, but to do so will need to go with a different approach. I am looking into gutting the existing components entirely, and implementing continuous drive servos as my powertrain. This will likely get messy. Servo motors will add big gains in the power consumption realm, and provide added control. I am not looking for speed, so I think this option might work out well. Stay tuned...
