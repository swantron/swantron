So, I've been doing this software thing for a while now. It is a strange, strange industry. It is becoming more apparent that every implementation of a generic service ends up falling into a similar life cycle. They all start with an idea, mash together a product, and go to market. The tricky part lies in new features, new connectivity, implementing the product on new technology as it arises, etc. That et cetera is sort of the name of the game. As the playing field changes, the product must too change. To make matters worse, things move at a quicker pace now more than ever. It is pretty shortsighted to assume your product will ever hit a true support phase. When that happens, you are likely no longer a player in your industry. The name of the game is managing your services... ![managed service provider](/uploads/2012/01/ncc_data.jpg "ncc_data") From time to time I check out hosting and virtualization providers on the nets. I stumbled across NCC Data, a \[shitty company who bought a link\] offers a product that essentially addresses my rant above. The key word is, undoubtedly, manage. Once you hit a certain level of critical mass, you must make the decision weather to support your goods in house (custom code, legacy systems, chopped and screwed...) or take on somebody to hammer out your details. NCC can handle your virtualization, support, security, and the whole other range of hosting headaches. Hit the link to take a look.
