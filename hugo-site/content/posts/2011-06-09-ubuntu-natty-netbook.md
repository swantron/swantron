As my primary notebook has proven that can run several terminals, a Firefox tab or four, Eclipse, and the Arduino IDE simultaneously without shitting the bed, it is time for my netbook to follow suit. Q: What suit? A: The Ubuntu 11.04 suit...you know, Natty Narwhal? Q: I don't know cards. This is cards, with the suit thing, right? A: Busted. No idea...very unsure of the spelling of 'suit' too FWIW ![ubuntu natty](/uploads/2011/06/natty-upgrade.jpg "natty-upgrade") Tune in tomorrow to see how it all ends up. Wear a suit.
