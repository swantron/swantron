Yesterday marked the official [iPad](http://www.pcworld.co.uk) release in the UK, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and Switzerland. And our neighbors to the North, Canada. I'm trying to think of an insult to Canada, but all I can come up with is ehPad. I think I'll go with that...Apple ehPad. We Yankees have had these around for what seems like a long time. What is the current state of the latest Apple buzz-inducing product? \[caption id="attachment\_2227" align="aligncenter" width="500" caption="little robot dude looks happy"\][![robo](/uploads/2010/05/apple-ipad.jpg "apple-ipad")](/uploads/2010/05/apple-ipad.jpg)\[/caption\] Well, apps, for starters. Apple managed to get a huge bump due to the iPhone developer core. Granted a bunch of the available apps are 'iPhone ports' so to speak, there are tons and tons of them. I really like a few of the ideas that have been thrown around. From the simple-ish ideas, like an air hockey game... \[caption id="attachment\_2228" align="aligncenter" width="500" caption="Pong 2.0"\][![air hockey](/uploads/2010/05/ipad-air-hockey.jpg "ipad-air-hockey")](/uploads/2010/05/ipad-air-hockey.jpg)\[/caption\] ...to the **h*holier than though less than two iPhone and an iPad having squares need not appl***y apps... \[caption id="attachment\_2229" align="aligncenter" width="500" caption="what do you do with Zs...or Xs"\][![scrabble](/uploads/2010/05/scrabble-ipad.jpg "scrabble-ipad")](/uploads/2010/05/scrabble-ipad.jpg)\[/caption\] ...there are some very entertaining apps for purchase. I like that Scrabble notion quite a bit. I bet I could do that with a pair of Droids and a Linux tablet, but I digress. I need to make more money writing paid posts like this, before I can think about two Droids. Fail. The one thing that has fallen off the radar is the marketing point that the iPad was to be the Kindle killer. I have not seen any press regarding using an iPad as an e-book reader, which on the onset was one of the primary selling points. It could be an issue with battery life, with respect to the Kindle's battery kind e-ink. More likely, it is easier to show flashy things like gaming on the units...makes for a more interesting story, I suppose. I guess I'm still on the fence. As is the case with all things techy and new, I still want one. You can keep the iPhones though...I'm not biting there. In the mean time, I'm going to see if my ehPad meme takes off.
