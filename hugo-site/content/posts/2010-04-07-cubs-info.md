Just a friendly reminder, 26outs.com is still up and rolling. And Carlos Zambrano is less than good. Horrible, in fact...first outing was a dismal *4-fucking-outs-horrible*. \[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="300" caption="ERA through the flipping roof in '10"\]![zambrano](/uploads/2010/04/bigz.jpg "big-z")\[/caption\] Quite unfortunately, the other Big Z, Matt Zignego, has been sitting on his thumb and not blogging. As bjordan would say, sad panda. Regardless, Gameday Audio is functional again, and I'm streaming currently. Go Dempster; Go Cubs.
