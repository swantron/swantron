I've been trying to snag a Bag O' Crap from Woot since 2007. At long last, victory is mine. ![woot bag o crap](/uploads/2011/05/bag-o-crap.jpg "bag-o-crap") I verified that my card has been billed...it appears legit. I might have to post a nerdy un-boxing vid. Pretty excited here. For the record, I have used trackers in the past to no avail...this one was done with pure dumb-luck. No bots, for the win.
