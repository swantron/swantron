bouncerblog.com loves traffic. bouncerblog.com really loves all of you that actually read bouncerblog.com, and sort of loves all of you that like to look at bouncerblog.com's pictures. bouncerblog.com can only post a finite number of pictures of Bouncer B.O.B.'s Larry Bird 'stache; that fact is strictly spelled out in the contract with our host, siteground. Anyhow. One of my favorite things to do is look in to our search terms. The bulk of our traffic is direct. Our second source is images.google.com...which is more often than not the product of my random photo tags. The most obscure traffic comes from random folks googlin' and askin' jeeves really random junk. See below: 1 12 6.06% joe swanson 2 7 3.54% jlo ass 3 6 3.03% only dudes 4 6 3.03% saddam 5 6 3.03% shitty car 6 6 3.03% stupid 7 5 2.53% hematoma 8 5 2.53% piece of shit car 9 5 2.53% stupid car 10 4 2.02% stupids car 11 4 2.02% biba golic 12 3 1.52% anna kournikova 13 3 1.52% bouncer blog 14 3 1.52% shirtless 15 2 1.01% family guy joe swanson 16 2 1.01% good photoshop 17 2 1.01% anna kournikova ass 18 2 1.01% big pimpin 19 2 1.01% billie joes tattoos 20 2 1.01% bobcat mascot Top twenty search terms, as per the first four days of April. How pissed would you be if you were looking for a picture of J-Lo's ass and found yourself ankle deep in MC Hammer videos and mustache pictures?
