It (still) never rains... ![boc woot](/uploads/2011/11/boc-woot-570x320.jpg "boc-woot") The second woot bag of crap is equally as crappy. <iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="386" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/S222cPqiQ00" width="569"></iframe>...as much as I like refurbished ethernet routers, I think BOC round two wins. Winning being on an inverted scale, whereas less crappy is awarded more points. I can chop up USB Guard Dog for its infared sensor, and the small Swanson girl will play with the caped monkey. Win win for the win...
