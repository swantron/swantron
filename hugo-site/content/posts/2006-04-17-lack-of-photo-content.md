Either we are having less fun these days, or we are forgetting to document our antics for the site. I am guessing the later is the case, as per Josh's blood alcohol test. And this photo. ![mr T.jpg](/uploads/2006/04/mr%20T.jpg)This was the result of Cody, Biddy, NateDawgg, and much PBR hanging out all night a few weekends ago. As far as I can recall, Biddy showed up with Ryan's clippers, and there you have it. I gave Cody a Mr. T do for a short time...unfortunately my cellular phone photography skills seemed to have been slightly compromised. Anyhow...that is old news. Lets get some content.
