You have to fuel the machine... ![work_food](/uploads/2010/11/work_food.jpg "work_food") I guess if this particular software developing machine starts to run on E, it can make a make-shift sandwich out of crackers, peanut butter, Doritos, and EZ Cheese. Maybe smash some jalapeno Cheetos in that sucker...
