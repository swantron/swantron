I'm writing this post on the road. Opera Mini is what it is... It certainly is not a blogger's smoothest means of posting content. That said, another day another dollar; there are paid posts to write. Like this guy about Kodak cameras. \[caption id="attachment\_2344" align="aligncenter" width="575" caption="easy breezy"\][![easy](/uploads/2010/06/kodak-easy-share.jpg "kodak-easy-share")](/uploads/2010/06/kodak-easy-share.jpg)\[/caption\] The posting tool isn't optimum, but the timing is right. We made it to Helena without our trusty [easyshare digital camera](http://www.pricespider.com/compare-prices-point-shoot/kodak/easyshare-digital-camera-silver-m340-8936650-1996645.html). I should say the 'we' with a disclaimer, since it is a bright pink Kodak Easy Share. Color aside, I love the thing. The picture quality is super, and the user interface is super easy to use to boot. I'd you haven't tried Kodak cameras in the past few years, you should give one a shot before buying another brand. They really have focused on usability instead of the bells and whistles, and have the best easy-to-use product on the market. They still have the features that the average consumer wants, but leaves out the type of additional stuff that is largely unused by most. Check one out. They are fairly inexpensive now, and give you a ton of bang for your buck.
