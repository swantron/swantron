As I mentioned in the post that precedes this one, I have been assembling things on a larger scale lately. Well, larger scale for a smaller scale person...getting the nursery ready, namely. Both the crib and changing table came together nicely. Enjoy some pics and protips. **Protip: Although the product may merely require "a screwdriver" for assembly, this will take all day. You will want an electric drill.** ![building changing table](/uploads/2011/09/building-changing-table-570x320.jpg "building-changing-table") Right after the unboxing phase of this project, I found myself en route to Lowe's. Not going to happen manually. **Protip: Lithium Ion battery technology is vastly superior to other cordless drill battery types. Take my word on this.** With long spans, tight threads, and two hands, it may be tough to get joints lined up. No problem... **Protip: Shim during assembly to level stuff.**![building baby furniture](/uploads/2011/09/building-bably-furn-570x320.jpg "building-bably-furn") There are all sorts of pieces in a kit of this size. Plenty of items with which to level other items. With curved edges on these pieces, I found myself using unused parts and towels to prop thing up, etc. Which leads me to... **Protip: Assemble loosely, level, tighten.** ![changing table done](/uploads/2011/09/ch-table-done-570x320.jpg "ch-table-done") That sucker is so level, we have simultaneous picture action. +1 photogenic. On to the crib...assembly was similar, but quicker. Same protips, with the addition of **Protip: Prepare tools ahead of time.**![crib assembly](/uploads/2011/09/crib-built-570x320.jpg "crib-built") You sure wouldn't want to find yourself with warm OMLs, a dead battery, etc. Sort of along the same lines as 'measure twice, cut once.' Only, more important. So, the paint on those walls is new as well. This room is getting close to done...with three months to spare. Hopefully it turns out well...especially as there is no chance that the crib will fit through the door in an assembled state. I have a feeling it will be just fine.
