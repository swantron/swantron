Spam filter for physical mail. Somebody run with it. We must have been inserted into some sort of new homeowners database. Each day, several 'official looking, if this was 1983 or so' letters show up in the mailbox. Most of them are attempting to bilk me out of money for 'special homeowner's life insurance' or something of that nature. Thanks, but no thanks. There is a bright side to this spam...they all have return postage.

You're all welcome.
