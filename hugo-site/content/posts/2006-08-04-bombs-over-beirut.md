I stumbled across these pics on cnn.com. They are pretty remarkable. ![lebanon.jpg](/uploads/2006/08/lebanon.jpg)These were taken from a Hezbollah-laden suburb of Beirut on the twelfth and twenty-second of July respectfully. Seeing as how there have been thousands of pounds more explosives dropped on the joint in the past two weeks, and moreover that the US plans to let Israel pound on these fuckers for at least another week before anything happens, I can only imagine that this is only a glimpse at the wreckage. Good thing Canadians are pretty much just beer drinking funny talkers.
