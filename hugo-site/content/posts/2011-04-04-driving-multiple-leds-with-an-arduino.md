I have had a bunch of white LEDs in my Amazon shopping cart for quite some time. I was tossing around the idea of doing a 5x5 cube a while ago, but ran out of steam on that project. I blame the PowerSwitch Tail...I had relays on the brain, big time. Still drafting out my big project on that front; stay tuned for some sweet garage door action. I rarely find my self with two projects in flight, that may actually turn into something, but I just might have stumbled back into the LED arena. Long story short, I had my Arduino, Mini 9, some white LEDs, and exactly seven jumper wires in my backpack. I stepped upstairs at work for lunch, and decided to horse around with them...see what it takes to run multiple LEDs. Seems basic, and it is. Fortunately...

I managed to grab the time-stamp notion from[ this sketch that is included with the IDE](http://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/BlinkWithoutDelay), and run with the rest of it. There will be snippet, but snippet will follow A SWEET VIDEO FTW Video / snippet / wrap-up after the bump [<span aria-label="Continue reading Driving Multiple LEDs with an Arduino">(more…)</span>](https://swantron.com/index.php/2011/04/04/driving-multiple-leds-with-an-arduino/#more-3367)
