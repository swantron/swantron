Impatiently awaiting my Dremel from Amazon, I made an executive decision that Clocky's bright orange motif had to go. Clocky already had some big rims; sort of like my SS. Sort of too like my Yukon. Hmm...black and chrome...sort of a no-brainer. Step 1: teardown / spray paint \[caption id="attachment\_4408" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="parts"\][![tear down](/uploads/2012/02/tear-down-570x232.jpg "tear-down")](https://swantron.com/rattle-can-makeover/tear-down/)\[/caption\] Step 2: Re-assemble \[caption id="attachment\_4409" align="aligncenter" width="1000" caption="sum of parts"\][![bringin sexy black](/uploads/2012/02/bringin-sexy-black.jpg "bringin-sexy-black")](https://swantron.com/rattle-can-makeover/bringin-sexy-black/)\[/caption\] Much better. Hoping to have the little guy rotary-drilled and souped-up before too long. Check back in soon.
