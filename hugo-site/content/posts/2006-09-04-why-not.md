A hour or so after that last post this is where things ended up. ![chest2.jpg](/uploads/2006/09/chest2.jpg)![chest.jpg](/uploads/2006/09/chest.jpg)That's right, a good ol' fashioned chest shavin'. Cody had a reverse Eddie Munster thing going on with his hair which was looking like the precursor to a MacGuyver mullet which we decided to take care of. Drunk. After cleaning up the neckline, I suggested that Cody go ahead and take care of the chest hair, which for some reason occurred. Cory and I had to step in after a nipple wound showed up. Wow.
