It is March. Happy March. Coming off our first month of declining numbers, bouncerblog.com is still going strong. Though Hatshop (I am working with hospitalpantshop or perhaps bluepaperpantshop) Tony is banged up, and Grif is second-guessing our mustache tradition, I am keeping it gangsta. ![rocawear.jpg](/uploads/2006/03/rocawear.jpg)I purchased a new Rocawear backpack to trizzansfer my bizzoks and lizzaptizzop computahh. Moreover, I will be basking in the Jamaican sun in no time. With board shorts on. Anyway, I know some of our regulars have sweet trips planned...keep us in mind. Drew, I will wire you some cash to go back to the Shaft. We love content. And drunk Tony. ![Tonyhurt.jpg](/uploads/2006/03/Tonyhurt.jpg)This may be my favorite picture we have pulled out of the bar to date. Tony tardin' out and Grif with a standard bouncer pose in the background.
