Some career-oriented things have kept me largely out of the Bad Lab. I finally decided to dust of the soldering station and get a permanent power connector surface mounted to my IOIO board. I tackled this project before I headed to work...I think the pre-coffee pre-jitter scenario worked out well. Anyhow, this is the component from SparkFun: \[caption id="attachment\_3749" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="tiny surface mount is tiny"\][![surface mount power jack](/uploads/2011/08/Surface-Mount-Power-Jack.jpg "Surface-Mount-Power-Jack")](/uploads/2011/08/Surface-Mount-Power-Jack.jpg)\[/caption\] It is a simple two pin surface mount compact connector. Nice current rating, so I am hoping it will give me enough juice to pull 5V in my pull-up project. The issue to overcome in the actual soldering was keeping this little sucker in place and stable to get the first joint in place. My solution, once again, ended up involving my adjustable clamps. These things are great, especially compared to the 'helper hands' alligator clip stand. Wonky hands would be more apt. \[caption id="attachment\_3748" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="+2 clamps"\][![clampy](/uploads/2011/08/Barrel-Jack-IOIO.jpg "Barrel-Jack-IOIO")](/uploads/2011/08/Barrel-Jack-IOIO.jpg)\[/caption\] For a little connector, it seems to be fairly secure. I also picked up a barrel jack to two pin connector from SparkFun. \[caption id="attachment\_3750" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="surface mount mounted"\][![mount surface](/uploads/2011/08/IOIO-surface-mount.jpg "IOIO-surface-mount")](/uploads/2011/08/IOIO-surface-mount.jpg)\[/caption\] Hooked up to a wall wart...survey says: \[caption id="attachment\_3747" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="power-ed up"\][![ioio power](/uploads/2011/08/IOIO-Power.jpg "IOIO-Power")](/uploads/2011/08/IOIO-Power.jpg)\[/caption\] We have power. I will test it against some loads, and get back on the pull-up project. Here goes nothing...
