If there is one thing I like more than animated GIFs, it is buffalo burger. And I love me some animated Gifs...following that line of reasoning, I *really* love me some buffalo burger. [![burgeranimation](/uploads/2009/12/burgeranimation.gif "burgeranimation")](/uploads/2009/12/burgeranimation.gif)How about that slick guy^ ? And those slick burgers ^ ? Here is The Perfect Buffalo Burger recipe: Step 1) Place 1/2 lb ground buffalo in bowl Step 2) Add a few shakes of Worcestershire sauce (feel free to substitute Gloucestershire, Dorchester, or any other German-sounding sauce) Step 3) Toss in some bread crumbs...this will soak up what little fat there is, and keep the burgers from drying out Step 4) Fire up the George Foreman Grill...knock that sucker out Step 5) Cook until desired "done-ness" is achieved...I like my buffalo mooing, so two minutes per side is about perfect. Step 6) Assemble, and enjoy. Note: DO NOT OVERCOOK BUFFALO... order/eat it a full level of done-ness below how you would beef. Trust me on this one. Note 2: UBUNTU RULES... try tossing an animated gif together using the trial version of Corel Paint that comes with your stupid Windows machine. The Gimp is free as always with Karmic Koala. Linux rules. Trust me on this one, too.
