Here we go... \[caption id="attachment\_1666" align="aligncenter" width="536" caption="Locke, Chahhhlie, Hugo, and Joe"\][![](/uploads/2010/02/lost-kate.jpg "lost-kate")](/uploads/2010/02/lost-kate.jpg)\[/caption\] I re-watched the last half (non Kate B.S. portion) of episode 2 today on the elliptical...here go the musings. ~ The date on Claire's Ethan produced ultrasound is a month or so past the original crash date. WTF, yo? No ideas here. ~ The Temple Others leader (Dogan?) has a baseball on his desk...brings to mind the whole Red Sox win The Series interplay between Jack and Ben. I suspect this to be big, since it was telegraphed. ~ Sawyer seemed genuinely sullen...jumped a peg in my favourite Lostie book.#1, FWIW ~ Claire = new Russoau? I butchered that spelling likely, but I don't care to look it up. Fuck you. ~ The "infection" mentioned. I'm guessing that Christian, Faux Locke, Eko's brother, and even Claire are all dead, and 'infected' per se. These are the people Russoau (suck it) was battling and cautious about...pretty obscure, but this is my take. and finally ~ The time lines will merge. The LAX dudes (2004) seem to intuitively know stuff that only the real time (be it 2007, via 2004&gt;&gt;1977&gt;&gt;1945&gt;&gt;2007 or directly from 2007) dudes know...I'm saying that Juliette's bomb somehow did this, and will explain why this is such. She was babbling about coffee with Sawyer when she was on her death bed, and said via Miles that it worked...just wait for it. Regardless, things are going to have to be very fast paced to wrap up in &lt; 10 hours...should be very interesing
