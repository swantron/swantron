Boxes are the essence of moving...and cardboard is the essence of boxes ![u-pack boxes](/uploads/2010/04/u-pack.jpg "u-pack") If you have a pending move on the horizon, you should most assuredly [buy boxes](http://www.upack.com/moving-supplies/moving-boxes.asp) from ABF U-Pack Moving...and not just because they paid me to say that. They offer a superior product, plain and simple. Having undergone several moves in my day, I can tell you with some certainty that having the right boxes will make the entire process far, far easier. U-Pack offers bundled packages, box assortments, and single boxes of many given sizes. In addition to the actual boxes themselves, they offer moving and packing supplies...basically your moving one-stop moving shop. FTW. Hit the above link for a clearer picture of what U-Pack has to offer...FWIW, you can schedule a reservateion for your move and get 10% lopped off the cost. Not too shabby.
