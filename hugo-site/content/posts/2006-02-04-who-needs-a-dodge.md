I am sure a few of our more faithful readers (yeah, that is you John Bach...stop buying Grif and I shots of Beam) will remember this gem from a few months back. ![cars2.jpg](/uploads/2006/02/cars2.jpg)Two Ford Fiestas in the McDonald's parking lot. I was wondering what the odds of that occuring were exactly...pretty funny stuff. Well, I can say with some confidence that this is less probable. ![vans.jpg](/uploads/2006/02/vans.jpg)When I saw the blue Pontiac Trans Sport SE at our construction job site I got a good laugh. When the second Pontiac Trans Sport SE swung on in my reaction was more along the lines of "are you fucking kidding me." Keep in mind that contractors and construction people in general usually tend to drive trucks, and that these two dudes have their goofy looking vans pulled into the lot with authority. Get real.
