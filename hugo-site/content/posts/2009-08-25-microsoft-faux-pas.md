This is pretty ridiculous...and funny. Apparently the Polish hate black people. Microsoft posted this on the English site... \[caption id="attachment\_955" align="aligncenter" width="586" caption="from the English site..."\]![from the English site...](/uploads/2009/08/microsoft_US.jpg "microsoft_US")\[/caption\] ...and this bad boy on their Polish site: \[caption id="attachment\_956" align="aligncenter" width="585" caption="...and from the Polish site."\]![...and from the Polish site.](/uploads/2009/08/microsoft_Poland.jpg "microsoft_Poland")\[/caption\] They must not have Photoshop over at the Microsoft campus. I could see how making that little swap-er-oo could be difficult using MS Paint. They could at very least have used the spray paint tool to lighten up the dude's hand...just a suggestion.
