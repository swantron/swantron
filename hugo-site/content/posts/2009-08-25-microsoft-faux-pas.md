This is pretty ridiculous...and funny. Apparently the Polish hate black people. Microsoft posted this on the English site... ![from the English site...](/uploads/2009/08/microsoft_US.jpg "microsoft_US") ...and this bad boy on their Polish site: ![...and from the Polish site.](/uploads/2009/08/microsoft_Poland.jpg "microsoft_Poland") They must not have Photoshop over at the Microsoft campus. I could see how making that little swap-er-oo could be difficult using MS Paint. They could at very least have used the spray paint tool to lighten up the dude's hand...just a suggestion.
