How times change. I can remember a time in the not-so-distant past where AOL disks would show up in the mail on a daily basis. Flash forward less than a decade, and here we are with a bevy of internet service provider options. You name it, DSL...cable...satellite, mobile wireless, and even ol' clunky, dial-up can be tracked down in 2010. The question is: where to start? How about right here at this link about [internet providers](http://www.ispcompared.com). ISPcompared.com has a bunch of slick content on their site. Here is the one that jumped out at me. They have a tool with which you can gauge your internet speed. Here is the result of my test. \[caption id="attachment\_2058" align="aligncenter" width="622" caption="graphs are c00l"\][![graph](/uploads/2010/04/internet_speed.jpg "internet_speed")](/uploads/2010/04/internet_speed.jpg)\[/caption\] Oh snaps! I'm closer to the T2 than to the T1, you Bresnan suckaz! ~~Note: I don't care for Bresnan much...between the spotty cable "reception" and the broken HDMI out on my DVR, I am not a proponent of Bresnan. The internet connection is screaming fast, however. Moreover, venting about Bresnan is good times~~ Anyhow, the above link has some other good material. Using the Broadband Internet Service Lookup Tool, I managed to plug my info for Bozeman in and see my options. Unfortunately, looks like the Verizon deal might be worth a second look. Unfortunate, since Verizon's customer service is actually worse than that of Bresnan. Tech support FTL. On a lighter note, check this out... \[caption id="attachment\_2057" align="aligncenter" width="840" caption="Dial-up Fail"\][![dialup](/uploads/2010/04/internet_speed2.jpg "internet_speed2")](/uploads/2010/04/internet_speed2.jpg)\[/caption\] It is completely Martian to me when I see or hear about somebody using dial-up. But...a ton of people do. God only knows why...with prices like those. Also, I assumed my parents were the only people left in the world not using webmail. That list made me laugh...I wonder if swantron@juno.platinum.com is taken? I couldn't be that fortunate...I'd probably end up with robot\_ninjaaa69@juno.platinum.com. Which is very awesome.
