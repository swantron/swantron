My source for the Arduino Motor Shield would not approve of my soldering iron. Not by any means... \[caption id="attachment\_2547" align="aligncenter" width="550" caption="fail"\][![lady ada](/uploads/2010/08/IMG00234.jpg "soldering iron")](/uploads/2010/08/IMG00234.jpg)\[/caption\] I still have the 'made in china' tag on this piece of shit. Poorly played. In case any of my reader-base has taken an interest in microcontrollers, robotics, or awesome crap in general, [Lady Ada ](http://adafruit.com/)has you covered. I recieved my motor shield in no time what-so-ever, and Limor's prices smoke those of Amazon to boot. Don't get me started about her tutorials...pretty bad ass. I need to toss the pictured iron in the trash and get a real iron before I get after my motor shield project...I can say that the servos she shipped me are tits.
