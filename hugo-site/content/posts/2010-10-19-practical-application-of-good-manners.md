Should a styrofoam container implore that I do something, you had better believe that I'm typically going to be less than receptive. However, when I ran across a styrofoam container kindly urging me to have a nice day, I was humbled by its good-hearted nature. \[caption id="attachment\_2787" align="aligncenter" width="545" caption="ditto"\][![ditto](/uploads/2010/10/have_a_nice_day.jpg "have_a_nice_day")](/uploads/2010/10/have_a_nice_day.jpg)\[/caption\] Leaving a kind note in reply is good etiquette.
