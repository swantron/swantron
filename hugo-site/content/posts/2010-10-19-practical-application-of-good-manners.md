Should a styrofoam container implore that I do something, you had better believe that I'm typically going to be less than receptive. However, when I ran across a styrofoam container kindly urging me to have a nice day, I was humbled by its good-hearted nature. ![ditto](/uploads/2010/10/have_a_nice_day.jpg "have_a_nice_day") Leaving a kind note in reply is good etiquette.
