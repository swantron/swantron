You know what? I'm pretty pumped I graduated when I did. Compared to my little sister, who is currently in the university system in Idaho, I paid practically nothing for my undergraduate degree. **My mathematical science degree, for the win**. Five grand does *not* go very far these days...and I'm fairly certain that five grand a year was enough to secure my degree. Beer and Doritos pushed that cost well over ten thousand a year, but I digress. Well, fear not. Technology to the rescue! ![computer-dude](/uploads/2010/05/computer-dude.jpg "computer-dude") Online courses were just coming to prevalence when I was wrapping up at Montana State. Granted, the foothold that was in place was primarily for continuing education, and for remote learning for secondary school teachers. Go figure. But, times change, and now there are crazy options in the field of online, higher education. Remember the University of Phoenix? Now they are simply one of many "Online Universities", along with a grip of "Traditional Universities" offering online degrees. Per the title of this post, I found it interesting that the popularity contest in this field ranks as follows: 1) Business Degrees 2) Criminal Justice Degrees 3) Art &amp; Design Degrees 4) Computer Science Degrees and letter number 5) Engineering Degrees Invert the list (5 --&gt; 1, for those unfamiliar with the term) to see the degrees I would pursue, in perfect order. Stick a "Chemical" in between the "5)" and "Engineering" to be completely specific. Anyhow, with the spread of online degrees and acceptance, per se, comes other benefits that were once enjoyed only by students of traditional schools. Like [financial aid](http://www.classesandcareers.com/financial-aid). This is the perfect opportunity to boost the resume, in a time of economic (and job) uncertainty such as this. Take a look...it is pretty slick.
