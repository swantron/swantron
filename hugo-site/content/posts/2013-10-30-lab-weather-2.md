My small lab assistant and I have our anti-cabin fever project figured out... [![pinchy](/uploads/2013/10/robot_arm.jpg)](https://swantron.com/lab-weather/robot_arm/)Phase 1) Assemble as is Phase 2) Go nuts for a while Phase 3) Sever wires / attach to breadboard Phase 4) Automate with Arduino I forgot Phase 0, which is a refresher course on 'soldering irons being very hot: "ouch"' As long as there are screwdrivers and wires involved, Emma will be into it. Could be very fun...
