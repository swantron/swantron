I'm one step closer to dropping an app on the Android Market. I'm thinking 'live wallpaper.' The existing ones on the market are weak sauce, so I might be able to get some downloads. Keyword, "might." That might be a pipe dream. Anyhow, I'm learning how to render stuff in 3D using OpenGL. I have got the cube down, since it is easy. ![animated_gif](/uploads/2011/01/animated_gif.gif "animated_gif") You're welcome for that animated gif ^ I'd like to have something (crappy) on the market in a few weeks. Don't hold your breath, but we'll see what I can toss together.
