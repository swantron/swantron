Dave, Chuck Chizzlah, and I are currently being snowed out of our latest fence project. Blah blah blah, Montana weather, blah blah blah. I realized that I have yet to post a picture of the newest addition to my Federline look, courtesy of Twig from Hart &amp; Huntington at the Palms. ![mttat2.jpg](/uploads/2007/03/mttat2.jpg)I think I should quit while I am ahead. Three nerd-ass tattoos are plenty.
