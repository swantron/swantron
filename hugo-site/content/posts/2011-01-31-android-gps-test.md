As I type this, there are over thirty satellites blasting around geo-sync orbits transmitting GPS data. As luck has it, my battery-ass-draining phone has a receiver built-in GPS receiver, of which now I am a master. Not really, but I can read the info... \[caption id="attachment\_3151" align="aligncenter" width="392" caption="Boring, FTL"\][![screenshot](/uploads/2011/01/gpsinfo.jpg "gpsinfo")](/uploads/2011/01/gpsinfo.jpg)\[/caption\] Location, time, velocity, etc. Not sure how to tune this yet, as the above was done via an emulator. Since my Studio 15 doesn't exactly (read: at all) have a GPS receiver or accelerometer, I'm working somewhat blindly. I did have some luck when I dropped my app on the Droid 2... \[caption id="attachment\_3152" align="aligncenter" width="550" caption="\\'Lab\\' is too cold, FTL"\][![hmm](/uploads/2011/01/lou_p.jpg "lou_p")](/uploads/2011/01/lou_p.jpg)\[/caption\] ...but that screen cap does a better job of showing the MLB Network reflection than the info on the screen. Sweet Lou should be in the top ten list of managers, FWIW. Glad he could make an appearance. Back to the GPS stuff. Cross referencing the data that I managed to pull in from the SDK library info, I was able to verify that the elevation was fairly accurate (w/in a hundred yards of Bozo Wikipedia listing) and the latitude / longitude was functioning well to several yards accuracy, relatively speaking. Not too bad. The next step would be to figure out how to put this to use. A ballistics chart would be pretty cool (read, profitable) if the elevation info could be read in automatically along with weather conditions. I'm not really sure...this one was more of an exercise in reading sensors and tossing out output. The accelerometer is next...I'll shoot to provide a better write-up at that point. Less bonus baseball footage...or far more bonus baseball footage. Stay tuned.
