Remember that episode of Saved by the **B**ell when Zack Morris aka Preppy had the fast-talking teacher from the Micro Machines commercial who was apparently also a plumber? Well anyhow, Zack and Screech head to the bathroom and crank on the sinks, flush the toilets, and call the teacher to distract him...using a phone identical to this monster. ![zackmorris.jpg](/uploads/2006/08/zackmorris.jpg)Well their ruse fails and Jesse Spano ends up writing so fast that smoke erupts from her test. I do not believe Screech's robot made an appearance.
