Where do you buy your toner? From a brick and mortar toner store? Get with the times... ![toner](/uploads/2011/02/toner.jpg "toner") As with pretty much anything tech-based, the only practical way to buy [toner cartridges](http://www.cartridgesdirect.com.au/toner_cartridges.aspx) these days is to buy them online. Not only do you save yourself a trip to the store, but a little shopping around will get you a far better price than heading down to the neighbourhood Staples to grab some toner.

It is the same racket as HDMI cables...fairly certain that a 8-foot HDMI doesn't cost thirty bucks to produce. But, I digress...
