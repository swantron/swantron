Mastering MS Paint is not as difficult as one may think. In fact, with a little practice you too can become a champion MS Paint-er. For maximum awesomeness, I employ a simple three-step approach: 1) Find an awesome picture to start with. Nintendo PowerGlove? Check. Kid from the Wonder Years? Check. Open that sucker up in MS Paint. ![](/uploads/2010/01/wiz.jpg "wiz") 2) Personalize. Chop your face out of another picture, using MS Paint. Paste it on the awesome picture from step 1, and drag the image to scale. ![](/uploads/2010/01/wiz2.jpg "wiz2") 3) Accessorize! This is the best part. See how the little shit from picture 1 has on sweet purple shades? Chop those suckers out, and throw it on that guy ^ you made in picture 2. ![](/uploads/2010/01/wiz3.jpg "wiz3") See! It is just that simple! And for the record...I'm all over those Warp Whistles in Mario 3. I'll be in World 8 before you can say racoon tail.
