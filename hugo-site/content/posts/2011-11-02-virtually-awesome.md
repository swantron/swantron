You may be wondering how I could one-up my work setup. Probably not, but play along. We are too .NET-y for me to nuke Windows, but Oracle-y enough to get carte blanch on a whole bunch of new stuff. Item one: VM Virtual Box Manager ![virtually awesome](/uploads/2011/11/virtual-570x318.jpg "virtual") I have an Ubuntu box rolling on the far right and an Oracle Linux box dead center. DropBox setup on the base machine and virtuals, for quick file mashing...diffing...command line python...grepping, etc. Good stuff. The only thing that could be more virtually awesome would be a fourth monitor running Arch Linux. Virtually unbeatable.
