I am going to have to wait until my caffeine levels are at some sort of equilibrium before I tackle this series of wire joints... \[caption id="attachment\_4137" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="thin wires are thin"\][![precision soldering](/uploads/2011/12/wires-570x245.jpg "wires")](/uploads/2011/12/wires.jpg)\[/caption\] ...this is where I stopped. I may be spending more time playing the new Zelda, and less time freezing balls in my lab working on my IOIO project. I'll get on it.
