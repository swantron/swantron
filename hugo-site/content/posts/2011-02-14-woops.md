Nuked that LED from space... ![blown led](/uploads/2011/02/blown_led.jpg "blown_led") In my ongoing fight with my Ethernet Shield, I had a bright idea that the sucker might have some bad jumpers. Welp, I put together a little blinking LED code and let it rip...which worked. I then tried to run the LED through the 3V lead...but...plugged the bastard into the 5V slot. Fire and brimstone. Long story short, the board is getting power, the jumpers are fine, and that sweet clear LED is toast.
