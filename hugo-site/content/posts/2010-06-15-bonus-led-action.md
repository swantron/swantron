Aftermath of my last Arduino session in my garage/workshop? Bonus LED action. ![bonus](/uploads/2010/06/solar-cell-led.jpg "solar-cell-led") It turns out my florescent lamp was pretty weak...the 7 O'Clock sun put it to shame, in the day-after mess of my 'lab.' Indirectly awesome. \*\*\*ADDITIONAL BONUS MATERIAL\*\*\* See if you can spot the following \* Netbook \* Notebook \* Zoot Badge \* Solar Panel \* USB cord \* Table \* Cardboard Box \* Other Random Electronics Crap Good Luck!
