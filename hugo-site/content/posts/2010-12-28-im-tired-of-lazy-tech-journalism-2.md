Tech writers are the best. I most certainly don't read the stuff that hits news aggregates because of informative banter and notable content, I read it for comic value. Well... comic value and insight into human nature. Most notably: laziness It seems to me that the easiest way to get published is to talk about a i\* killer. Replace the wildcard with either **"pod"**![pod](/uploads/2010/12/ipod_killer.jpg "ipod_killer") **"pad"**![pad](/uploads/2010/12/ipad_killer.jpg "ipad_killer") or **"phone"**... ![iphone](/uploads/2010/12/iphone_killer.jpg "iphone_killer") ...and write a half-assed article about a new product. Guaranteed Google, MSN, Yahoo, Drudge, or whoever else will have that bad boy on the front page. Protip: Next time you are charged with the task of covering a new Samsung product's press release, save some time and just go with "End of Apple???" and be done with it. The whole killer angle was spent several years ago...when we nerds were buying Sandisk players, loading Ubuntu on netbooks, and making wild guesses on forums what RIM was going to do with the next generation of BB phones. Oh....the good old days. FWIW, I'll put a Droid X up against all three of those products. For the price point, nothing can touch that machine...my Droid 2 included.
