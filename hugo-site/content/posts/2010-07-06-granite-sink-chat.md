I suppose I am picky when it comes to sinks. Not bad picky, but picky enough to know what I want. I spent the better part of a decade with double sink set-ups, between my restaurant and bar work experience. I may not be much of a doer of dishes, but set me up with two sinks, and I'll do my thing. ![dishes robot](/uploads/2010/07/dishes-bot.jpg "dishes-bot") Being a minimalist of sorts, I basically have two choices; [granite sinks](http://mrdirectint.com/sinksandfaucets/trugranite-sinks-c-47.html) or stainless steel sinks. I'm leaning towards the former, after seeing some sweet, black granite Mr Direct brand sinks. I was under the false assumption that all granite sinks were speckled and dirty looking. Not the case. ![nice](/uploads/2010/07/double-sink.jpg "double-sink") Pair that sink with a clean looking faucet apparatus like this... ![dig it](/uploads/2010/07/sink-stuff.jpg "sink-stuff") ...and all of a sudden, I guess I am a [granite sink](http://mrdirectint.com/sinksandfaucets/trugranite-sinks-c-47.html) guy. Hit one of those links above for the details. I most surely will when it is time to remodel our place.
