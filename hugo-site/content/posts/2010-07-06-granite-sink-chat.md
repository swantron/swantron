I suppose I am picky when it comes to sinks. Not bad picky, but picky enough to know what I want. I spent the better part of a decade with double sink set-ups, between my restaurant and bar work experience. I may not be much of a doer of dishes, but set me up with two sinks, and I'll do my thing. \[caption id="attachment\_2461" align="aligncenter" width="550" caption="SO ANGRY (not to perspective)"\][![dishes robot](/uploads/2010/07/dishes-bot.jpg "dishes-bot")](/uploads/2010/07/dishes-bot.jpg)\[/caption\] Being a minimalist of sorts, I basically have two choices; [granite sinks](http://mrdirectint.com/sinksandfaucets/trugranite-sinks-c-47.html) or stainless steel sinks. I'm leaning towards the former, after seeing some sweet, black granite Mr Direct brand sinks. I was under the false assumption that all granite sinks were speckled and dirty looking. Not the case. \[caption id="attachment\_2463" align="aligncenter" width="550" caption="+1 hides grime"\][![nice](/uploads/2010/07/double-sink.jpg "double-sink")](/uploads/2010/07/double-sink.jpg)\[/caption\] Pair that sink with a clean looking faucet apparatus like this... \[caption id="attachment\_2462" align="aligncenter" width="349" caption="dig it"\][![dig it](/uploads/2010/07/sink-stuff.jpg "sink-stuff")](/uploads/2010/07/sink-stuff.jpg)\[/caption\] ...and all of a sudden, I guess I am a [granite sink](http://mrdirectint.com/sinksandfaucets/trugranite-sinks-c-47.html) guy. Hit one of those links above for the details. I most surely will when it is time to remodel our place.
