After the whole fiasco that came with my upgrade to WordPress 3.2, I decided to shell my old layout and go with a new [free website builder](http://www.intuit.com/ "free
website builder"). Not only was it too bloated with jqueries, but the whole thing was sort of outdated. Time for some new blood, to go with my new (faster?) server. Introducing: Swiz3 ![wordpress 3.2 free layout](/uploads/2011/07/worpress3.2.jpg "worpress3.2") Way quicker than the Swiz2\* series. It turns out that WP has introduced a bunch of the custom menu junk that I formerly have fought with into their release, so out with the old. Consider this a working beta, and pay no attention to anything wonky on IE...haven't even looked at this site on that. Cheers.
