Not sure where this picture came from exactly...trying to get video working via Cheese on Ubuntu is my best guess. \[caption id="attachment\_3826" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="bad lab"\][![bad lab](/uploads/2011/09/working.jpg "working")](/uploads/2011/09/working.jpg)\[/caption\] It has been sitting on my desktop for a while, ready for something. There it is ^ My new job has kept me busy for the last three weeks. FWIW, RightNow Technologies is a great place to be...[check them out](http://www.rightnow.com/) by all means. I have been putting together baby furniture like a boss, expect a post on that soon. Had a few gotchas to share. Katie is still doing well, and things are falling into place; we may have a daycare picked out, which will be nice to have in the books. Exciting stuff...ready for this little girl to show up. Project wise, I'm going either one of two ways. I still have a boat-load of white LEDs to put to use. I am either thinking of banging out a quick Arduino (sorry for the neglect, little guy) project on that front, or trying to do some metering with the IOIO. I thought about doing a quick Ping sensor project for the IOIO as well, but figured that may turn into another multi-month ordeal. Might tackle some LEDs...debugging LEDs is pretty much a binary process. Works or does not work. Time will tell. But until then.
