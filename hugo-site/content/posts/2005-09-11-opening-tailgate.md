This Saturday marked the Montana State Fighting Bobcat’s home opener. The MSU grounds crew has provided the Cats with a terrific playing surface this season…unbeknownst to most alum and practically all coeds in attendance, Grif and Steve Sampson included. ![](http://bouncerblog.com/wp-content/griff.jpg)![](http://bouncerblog.com/wp-content/photo_0051.jpg)To those nonattendees, the game is secondary to parking lot drinking…in fact, the game is often only evident when the cannon is torched after a touchdown. Pink, personalized Bubba Keg’s full of hops, skips, and goes, naked for some…Pabst Blue Ribbon for others. Interesting day, though. While I was putting together a wiring harness for my Yukon, Grif and Biddy were putting 30 Busch Lights in a cooler with Country Time and vodka. Gross…I do my best to avoid ingesting all three of those. A few hours elapse and my work flatbed trailer is the place to be for a few dozen hard drinking dudes and dudettes. Feel free to join us in two weeks. I don't imagine we will have grown up by then.
