My Arduino is *in da houze!*\[caption id="attachment\_1971" align="aligncenter" width="800" caption="Awesome. "\][![+1 Nerd](/uploads/2010/04/arduino.jpg "arduino")](/uploads/2010/04/arduino.jpg)\[/caption\] Arduino is an open-source electronics prototyping platform...and it is awesome. I went for the Arduino Duemilanove, packaged nicely with some LEDs, resisters, leads, and solderless breadboard. Did I mention this bad-boy employs USB connectivity? Prototyping, FTW! Next step: get this sucker talking to Ubuntu on my Mini 9. Step after that: turn on some LEDs Step even after that: MF-ing robot +1 Nerd, indeed.
