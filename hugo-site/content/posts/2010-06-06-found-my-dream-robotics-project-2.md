+1 Android +1 Arduino +1 Voice Recognition I found this guy [over at engadget](http://www.engadget.com/2010/04/05/android-and-arduino-packin-cellbot-features-voice-recognition/)...called truckbot, it packs the aforementioned awesome things I love. \[caption id="attachment\_2279" align="aligncenter" width="600" caption="I want to build this so badly"\][![cellbot](/uploads/2010/06/cellbot.jpg "cellbot")](/uploads/2010/06/cellbot.jpg)\[/caption\] Truckbot is autonomous...the little sucker won't drive off the edge of a table, even if user prompts it to. This may be a violation of one of Assimov's robot rules...go look it up. No time to blog...must continue drooling over this.
