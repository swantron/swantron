While I've been caught up dealing with the epic battle between the Moto Droid and the RIM Storm 2, there have been some slick phones dropping. FWIW, Motorola whupped the beans out of the Storm, whatever that means. Whatevs. Here is one in particular. The HTC HD2. \[caption id="attachment\_1991" align="aligncenter" width="550" caption="Heroic"\][![hero](/uploads/2010/04/HTC_HD2.jpg "HTC_HD2")](/uploads/2010/04/HTC_HD2.jpg)\[/caption\] This puppy is pretty much loaded. Like I'll be after this paid post... Really though, this is a sweet phone. 480x800 res screen at 4.3 inches...we're talking Eros stats. [HTC Accessories](http://www.talkietech.com) are where it is at, though. You can outfit this guy (which runs Microsoft Windows Mobile 6.5 Professional, for you Microsoft-eers) with all kinds of phone stuffs...hit that bump to find out more. Long story short...I need to stay up on my phone current events. I'm still clinging to my seen-better-days BlackBerry Pearl. For the loss.
