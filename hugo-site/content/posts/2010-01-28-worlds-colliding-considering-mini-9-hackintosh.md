It almost seems like a crime to own the most hackintosh-able netbook w/o hackintoshing the sumbitch. Ideal chipset...ideal ease of solid state HD and RAM upgrade. The only downside is my Linux fanboi-izm...and affinity to The Gimp. Ubuntu FTW. ![MINI 9](/uploads/2010/01/hackintosh-575x205.jpg "hackintosh") I'm uber-serios-ly considering making the bump. I really hate iTunes and anything else with a small i preceding a word, but think that iPhone/iTouch app dev might be worth the hassle. More to come...I have some contemplation to contemplate.
