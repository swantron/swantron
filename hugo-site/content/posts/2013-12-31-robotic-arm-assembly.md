The small lab assistant and I tackled the robot arm project last weekend. Fifty percent of team swan tron embarked upon the assembly phase wearing bunny slippers... [![bunny_slips](/uploads/2013/12/bunny_slips.jpg)](https://swantron.com/robotic-arm-assembly/bunny_slips/)We did this in two big chunks, due to attention span limitations and nap purposes.

That may be next, in a round-about way. I'd like to stick some rPi brains in this and build a web UI, so the small assistant can run this with a phone or tablet. We'll see where we end up with this.
