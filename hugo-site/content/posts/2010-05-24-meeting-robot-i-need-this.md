Best idea of the week...a robot to attend your meetings. ![right there](/uploads/2010/05/work-robot.png "work-robot") From dailymail.co.uk

> Fed up with attending endless meetings when you'd much rather be at home? Step forward the QB from Anybots - a robot who can go to the office for you. Developed by Bob Christopher, the brainchild behind the Pleo dinosaurs, the cute looking robot is essentially a teleconferencing system on wheels. The robot can alter its height from 3ft to 5.7ft and weighs 2.5st, with a main computer and several mini-computers on board. It has an LCD monitor mounted on its head which feeds a webcam image of the telecommuter. It 'sees' via a 5MP video camera in one eye, and a lower resolution camera on the head that points downwards. It 'hears' via three microphones that feed audio to the telecommuter, and has high-quality speakers for audio in the other direction.

Alright, nicely played. This thing costs 15K, however. I'm pretty sure I could do the same damned thing with an HTC Incredible, broom, Arduino, and an electric wheelchair motor. I would need an area to put some tattoos and earbuds, however. And somehow mimic my general sense of 'leave me alone before I effin snap' to be fully effective/reflective of me in a meeting situation. And a strong odor of coffee...definitely need that.
