Unfortunately the swirly light thing over Norway wasn't a visitor from outer-space. You crazy-ass Scientologists will have to wait for Xenu...turns out the spiral was just a little Ruskie submarine launched ballistic missile (SLBM) that failed.. [![slbm](/uploads/2009/12/slbm.jpg "slbm")](/uploads/2009/12/slbm.jpg)[Per the BBC:](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8405481.stm)*"A Russian test launch of an intercontinental missile has failed, resulting in a white light seen over parts of Norway. The submarine-based Bulava ballistic missile failed when launched from the White Sea, the Defence Ministry's press office told Itar-Tass news agency. Russian newspapers had earlier reported the failure. At least six of 13 previous tests also ended in failure. The Bulava can carry six individually targeted nuclear warheads. It is designed to have a range of 10,000km (6,200 miles), but its repeated failures have caused embarrassment for Russia which hoped it would support its nuclear deterrent. "*Great! Just a little SLBM mishap. Let's just assume that Russia and the States are buddies (or over 10,000km apart) and get back to worrying about Tiger Woods.
