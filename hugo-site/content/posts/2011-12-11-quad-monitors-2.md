The only better thing than one nice monitor is two nice monitors. The only thing better than two nice monitors, is one really nice monitor and a hi-res laptop monitor. The only thing better than one nice monitor and one laptop monitor is that, in addition to one sort of lousy monitor. So, I guess I am winning that game...my work setup is equally that: ![trips at work](/uploads/2011/12/triple_monitors_work-570x330.jpg "triple_monitors_work") I need to step it up and go for [quad monitors](http://www.multiplexpc.com/multiple-monitor-stands-s/108.htm). Quads would be great...I get sort of jealous when I see something like this when I am daydreaming of the perfect work setup: ![multiplex triple setup](/uploads/2011/12/mulitplex-570x260.png "mulitplex") Imagine something like that, with three of my 24"s from work sitting perfectly on my desk. Symmetrical, clean, and awesome. I found myself on Mulitiplex's site looking at some of their setups...I am completely in awe of this guy: ![quad setup](/uploads/2011/12/quad-monitor-556x570.png "quad-monitor") And hence the title of the post...I have an itch to put together a quad monitor setup. Big time. I am up in the air as to whether a single monitor on top of the triple monitor setup would be better than the giant quadrilateral, but either one would be amazing. Maybe I can get this up and going...
