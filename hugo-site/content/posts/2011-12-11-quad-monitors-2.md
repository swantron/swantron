The only better thing than one nice monitor is two nice monitors. The only thing better than two nice monitors, is one really nice monitor and a hi-res laptop monitor. The only thing better than one nice monitor and one laptop monitor is that, in addition to one sort of lousy monitor. So, I guess I am winning that game...my work setup is equally that: \[caption id="attachment\_4168" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="trips"\][![trips at work](/uploads/2011/12/triple_monitors_work-570x330.jpg "triple_monitors_work")](/uploads/2011/12/triple_monitors_work.jpg)\[/caption\] I need to step it up and go for [quad monitors](http://www.multiplexpc.com/multiple-monitor-stands-s/108.htm). Quads would be great...I get sort of jealous when I see something like this when I am daydreaming of the perfect work setup: \[caption id="attachment\_4169" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="fancy trips"\][![multiplex triple setup](/uploads/2011/12/mulitplex-570x260.png "mulitplex")](/uploads/2011/12/mulitplex.png)\[/caption\] Imagine something like that, with three of my 24"s from work sitting perfectly on my desk. Symmetrical, clean, and awesome. I found myself on Mulitiplex's site looking at some of their setups...I am completely in awe of this guy: \[caption id="attachment\_4170" align="aligncenter" width="556" caption="+4"\][![quad setup](/uploads/2011/12/quad-monitor-556x570.png "quad-monitor")](/uploads/2011/12/quad-monitor.png)\[/caption\] And hence the title of the post...I have an itch to put together a quad monitor setup. Big time. I am up in the air as to whether a single monitor on top of the triple monitor setup would be better than the giant quadrilateral, but either one would be amazing. Maybe I can get this up and going...
