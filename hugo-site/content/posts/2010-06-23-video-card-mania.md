At the risk of sounding like a grumpy (thirty year) old codger and really dating myself, I'm going to go ahead and wax sentimental for a second. We had an Atari way back in the day. Way back, as in I thought it was called a "Natari." It was awesome. My two favorite games... Frogger, maybe of course, and an obscure game called Gopher. Gopher involved whacking gophers on the head with a shovel as they tried to eat your carrots, which you planted as a stork dropped seeds. No way to win...just hold off the gophers until you go insane. Aah, the good old days. \[caption id="attachment\_2360" align="aligncenter" width="550" caption="anyone? anyone?"\][![atari](/uploads/2010/06/robot-atari.jpg "robot-atari")](/uploads/2010/06/robot-atari.jpg)\[/caption\] Don't get me wrong, I'm all about my Wii. Every once in a while, it is good to take a step back from the buzz and take a look at the state of things. I'm going to wager that \*most of the games thrown out to the market are not even slightly as rewarding to the player as Frogger, Gopher, or Pong for that matter. It is easy to get wrapped up in new things...super easy. It is often hard to qualify, when everything is marketed to its quantified value. The same exact thing holds true for my dear computers. I always want a new one. If not a new one completely, I want more RAM, a better video card, a meaty hard drive, etc. Even though I spend most of my time hammering out paid posts such as this, for some odd reason I think I need something that can store the Library of Congress and play two first person shooters simultaneously. It is a problem. Let's focus on [computer video cards ](<http://computers.pricegrabber.com/video-cards/p/5/ >)for a moment, to illustrate my point. I could, without a doubt, get by with a budget video card. Like this little guy: \[caption id="attachment\_2361" align="aligncenter" width="172" caption="the price is right"\][![bad](/uploads/2010/06/vidcard.jpg "vidcard")](/uploads/2010/06/vidcard.jpg)\[/caption\] However, my tech ego dictates that I look at things like this monstrosity: \[caption id="attachment\_2363" align="aligncenter" width="179" caption="the price is wrong"\][![bad](/uploads/2010/06/videocard1.jpg "videocard1")](/uploads/2010/06/videocard1.jpg)\[/caption\] ...and, I'm drooling a little. I don't need that...if you do, hit that link up there and check them out. I'm going to play some Wii.
