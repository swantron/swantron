I spend a fair amount of time blathering on about technology and current events. I figured I should put together a post to divulge some of my sources. Think of this either as a master "works cited" reference, or as a "read like Joe" document, of sorts. \[caption id="attachment\_2154" align="aligncenter" width="415" caption="holy smokes indeed"\][![holy smokes](/uploads/2010/05/reading-the-newspaper.jpg "reading-the-newspaper")](/uploads/2010/05/reading-the-newspaper.jpg)\[/caption\] Take note, I have not had a newspaper or magazine subscription for years. Years and years, actually. All of my sources are online...for better or worse. I'm all about my news...the more varied, the better. I typically begin by checking local online sources, namely the Bozeman Daily Chronicle and Billings Gazette. The Bozeman Police Reports alone make the Cronicle worth checking, for comedic value alone. When it comes to national news sources, I typically stick to drudgereport.com and news.google.com. Drudge is fairly conservative, (some might argue that he is uber-conservative, but I disagree) but fairly thorough. I have Google filtered to give me a ton of national and science-based stories. All in all, these both serve to collect news from a large variety of sources. It serves to keep the reader on his or her toes, by keeping fresh points of view present. I have a few more specialized news sources I check on a daily basis as well. I keep up with our neighbors across the pond with [euro news](http://www.euronewss.com), and stay current with my nerd news via slashdot. Euro News fills in the spaces missed by mainstream media regarding Europe, and slashdot fills in the things that media deems too obscure on which to report. I also check a few other random sites on a frequent basis. The Onion is the best, and their sister site AV Club offers some good reviews of music, games, movies, etc. Geekologie is quickly becoming a favorite as well...sort of like swantron, oddly enough. I keep up on my beloved Chicago Cubs on viewfromthebleachers.com, and to a lesser extent cubs.com. Consider yourselves warned...but please don't cut out the middleman and stop checking this site out. swantron.com FTW!
