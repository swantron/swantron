We took a Jefferson River float trip last weekend...we being Voy, Menke, Hennesy, Nate, Paps, and I. The day was overcast and we were drinking perhaps the worst Gatorade vodka concoctions ever concocted, but it was fun nonetheless. Long story short, upon our arrival at the take-out we come across a grip of law enforcement agents, all dealing with a girl who injured herself jumping off of a cliff into the river. That said, this was what we walked into. ![fucked.jpg](/uploads/2007/07/fucked.jpg)There is really nothing more sobering, I would imagine, than asking a sheriff to move his cruiser so that you can do a little drunk driving back upstream. Good work Menke. You worked your way out of a serious jam.
