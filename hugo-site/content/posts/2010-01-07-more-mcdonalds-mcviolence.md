> KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Surveillance video from a Midtown McDonald's restaurant on Main Street shows a woman experiencing hamburger rage. The incident happened on Dec. 27 and the video clearly shows a woman demanding a refund for what she claimed was an inferior hamburger. After being denied the refund, the video show her throwing a bucket of water over the counter along with other items, including a basket of straws, cookies, a sign and even three of the cash registers.
