I have about had it with Ahmadinejad. I have definitely had it with the [Royal British Marines](http://www.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/meast/04/06/iran.sailors/index.html) being fucking pussies as well. You are soldiers; why don't you act like it, dudes and dudette?

> The sailors and marines, who were seized from patrol boats on March 23, returned to the UK on Thursday after 13 days in Iranian captivity. Lt. Carman said they were kept in isolation, interrogated and blindfolded, and subjected to "aggressive questioning and rough handling."

![pussies](http://i.a.cnn.net/cnn/2007/WORLD/meast/04/06/iran.sailors/new1.britons.fri.11.ap.jpg)Isolation??? Not a blindfold!!! Have you animals no mercy??? I sure hope our governmental officials promptly impose rigid sanctions to put a stop to this aggressive questioning!!! Also, we wear funny looking hats!!!
