Recently, I found myself in a bind at work. I had chips, but no salsa...a true doozy of a predicament! Being a daft culinary whiz, I improvised a work-around: QUICK SALSA ![](/uploads/2012/03/quick-salsa.jpg "quick salsa") How to make Quick Salsa: 1) Find a flat (or nearly flat) surface 2) Arrange chips in a single layer upon the flat (or nearly flat) surface 3) Nail those bitches with sriracha 4) Enjoy!
