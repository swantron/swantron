Ten years and a few months ago, I became a licensed HAM operator... ![HAM Radio License](/uploads/2011/11/HAM-570x319.jpg "HAM") That means, without any doubt, that the satellite that MSU stuck in orbit last week has indeed been a long time coming. I'm running up to campus for the mission statement and a possible down-link tomorrow afternoon...stay tuned for this one. We have entered full-on geek mode.
