I'm not there yet, but let's chalk this one up as a step towards the end goal...which would be the title of this post. ***A Damned Arduino Robot!***\[caption id="attachment\_2077" align="aligncenter" width="800" caption="its....beautiful."\][![arduino](/uploads/2010/05/arduinos.jpg "arduinos")](/uploads/2010/05/arduinos.jpg)\[/caption\] Granted, this is basically just my hello world (hola mundo) program with the addition of a solderlss breadboard into the fray. But, it is awesome and, I am going to be the coolest dude on the block when I come rolling out with a bad-ass robot. I had better get back to work.
