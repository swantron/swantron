I have a strong suspicion that all of this shit will fade away. ![facebook is retarded](/uploads/2012/09/fb.png "fb") A webpage about a website, made for posting things about website posts. Really neat. Anyhow, some idiots who sell ads have this as a checkbox of sorts. Having facebook, G+, and Twitter integrations is important, for some reason. I don't know...let me blog and get off my lawn. [swantron.com/tw](https://swantron.com/tw)[swantron.com/fb](https://swantron.com/fb)[swantron.com/+](https://swantron.com/+)The Twitter link is my personal feed, which is basically an occasional link to a post (on this goddamned site.) The other two are unused, and shall likely remain that way. Happy interneting.
