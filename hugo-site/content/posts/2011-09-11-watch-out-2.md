Nerd cred is nerd cred, right? Not necessarily. Take, for instance, gaining nerd cred via unboxing a Woot BOC...pretty nerdy. That is contrasted by more nerdy nerd cred, like trading messages with the IOIO designer on his Google Groups page. Huge nerd cred. Another level of nerd cred comes via gadgets. Gadgetry is the best...on of my favorite things in the world. There are overt ways to geek out...like a screaming fast notebook running an obscure, maybe stable version of Linux. Bonus points for sure. Blogging is sort of credulous, but blogging the crap out of stuff and posting apps...gigantic nerd cred. Then comes watches. Nerd cred on the down-low. I'll go on record saying that [Invicta Men Watches](http://www.bluedial.com/invicta-watch-men.htm) are a source of geek cred. Take a look: ![invicta watch](/uploads/2011/09/invicta-big.jpg "invicta-big") You can nerd out by the design, or nerd out by the specs. I choose both, as that watch is crazy functional and crazy cool looking. Not slide rule and pocket protector cool, but pretty solid. The best deal, is the prices you can find on Invicta watches on BlueDial: ![big old watch](/uploads/2011/09/invicta-watch.jpg "invicta-watch") That doesn't even make sense. How they can chop the price that much is crazy. Blogging about watches crazy. Hit the link and check one out. It is a pretty sweet site, and you really won't beat that price anywhere.
