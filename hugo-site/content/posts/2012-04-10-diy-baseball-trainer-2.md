With men's league baseball around the corner and a new Baum Bat in my garage, I got antsy to hit some baseballs. Since the sidekick keeps me close to the house on weekends, I had to improvise. Enter, DIY Baseball Trainer... **Step one: Drill hole in baseball**![drilling a baseball](/uploads/2012/04/baseball-drill.jpg "baseball drill") \*Fun fact...I still haven't had to charge this lithium ion battery pack, after a whole bunch of baby furniture assembly and random tasks in the \*lab. Battery technology is great. **Step two: Attach ball tether** ![baseball trainer](/uploads/2012/04/baseball-trainer.jpg "baseball trainer") \*Fun fact... I have been looking for uses for old salvaged power cords. They are everywhere. **Step three: Attach unit to fixed point**![diy baseball trainer](/uploads/2012/04/diy-baseball.jpg "diy baseball") \*Fun fact...I had to go nuts with my tree trimmer in order to clear a suitable space to accommodate a baseball swing. I still have a sizable pile of tree that I am working into our garbage cans pre-pickup. **Step four: Get real**![broken cord](/uploads/2012/04/broken-cord.jpg "broken cord") \*Fun fact...I thought this would hold up for a while. It turns out 'a while' was two swings.
