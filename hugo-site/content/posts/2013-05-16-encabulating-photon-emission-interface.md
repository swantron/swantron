My small lab assistant and I tossed our hats in the ring and were invited to compete in the 2013 [Red Bull Creation](http://creation.redbullusa.com/) competition. In short, it was great. Team swan tron didn't make it to the finals, (this year, suckers) but had a great time and learned a ton. Dual hats off to the six teams heading to NY for the last phase...you all earned it. Team swan tron entered for consideration an Encabulating Photon Emission Interface. \[caption id="attachment\_4903" align="alignnone" width="1280"\][![team swan tron ](/uploads/2013/05/20130504_122847.jpg)](https://swantron.com/encabulating-photon-emission-interface/20130504_122847/) team swan tron\[/caption\] Red Bull's concept was simple and brilliant...the accepted applicants were given custom Arduino shields, a whole bunch of LEDs, and a path to a git repo containing a library with which to make them crank. That, about four weeks, and a nudge to do something awesome with lights. We did this... <iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/CQojL2KMAzE" width="560"></iframe>We used all of the PWM channels at our disposal to handle the colors on our Encabulating Interface, and tossed in some analog stuff for good measure. Our software utilized the Encabulator's accelerometer values as the interface's interfacing variables, which is nice. Most of the board's function was exercised, as was my brain, Emma's brain, and Emma in general. She liked the feedback in a belly laugh way...so that is that. Pretty sure she and I both came out ahead on this effort. Here's to 2014...look out for team swan tron.
