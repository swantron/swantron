Hey y'all. Quick disclaimer. I have no intentions of turning bouncerblog.com into a site wherein I publish photos of those whom I feel that I am better than. See, I just ended a sentence in a preposition; I am not without my flaws. Check this out though...as a youngster I wore my hair in the same manor as Ryne Sandburg, so I do understand that children are both impressionable and blind to their outward appearance. This is assinine, however. ![](http://www.bouncerblog.com/wp-content/photo_0040.jpg)![](http://www.bouncerblog.com/wp-content/photo_0041.jpg)![](http://www.bouncerblog.com/wp-content/photo_0042.jpg)I wore hockey hair, so did Ryno. I traded in my do for a more contemporary cut when Sandburg let me know it was time. I never, however, dressed like my grandmother. Give me a fucking break fellas. Moreover, there are two of you. You guys are telling me that you piled into a sedan unaware of the fact that you looked like your brother, let alone that you were dressed identical to your grandma...thumbs down. Swanny
