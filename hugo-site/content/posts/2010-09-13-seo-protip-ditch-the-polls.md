Many moons ago, I heard through the grapevine that slow sites are penalized by search engines. Being the owner of a fast-as-lightning-bro-you-better-get-your-Nikes-bro site, I didn't care. After plugging into the world of php, jquery, css, html, and a boat load of 3rd party crap on ol' swantron.com, I have a slow site. Waah. ![custom google logo](/uploads/2010/09/google-custom.jpg "google-custom") (Hint: that ampersand in front up there ^ means Twitter) Looking into the cause of my crappy speed numbers, the first culprit was my stupid "poll" plugin that I have been using. Nobody cares about the polls on a site, unless they have exhausted every other iota of content on said site. Not the case here. Not the case by a long shot. I do have some content that is popping in the search engines, however. Tons of impressions, in fact. I am lacking the placement, even on swantron-specific terms. Maybe my lean-and-mean approach will win me SEO gold, readership silver, and living off of saying dumb shit bronze. Maybe. Polls are officially off line until the jury has deliberated.
