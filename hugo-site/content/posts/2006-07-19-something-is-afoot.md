On my way home from work I spotted a) A late model accord, minus rear passenger window, with a "gone to race in a better place" Earnhardt memorial window cling, and b) A dude on a Segway I looked into Segways last week as a matter of fact. Though (already?) obscure, the sumbitches still go for at least three g's on eBay. Maybe I get a fixer-upper and throw a set of Earnhardt wings on the side. Sorry for the lack of photos by the way...I managed to lose my LG yesterday at work.
