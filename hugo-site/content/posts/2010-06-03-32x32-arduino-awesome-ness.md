I wish I had done this...unfortunately, I have my hands full with a handfull of LEDs. 1024 LEDs...give me a break. Osgeld (a man amongst boys) over at the [arduino forums](http://www.arduino.cc/cgi-bin/yabb2/YaBB.pl?num=1267250236) showed off his 32x32 dot matrix panel proof of concept. \[caption id="attachment\_2248" align="aligncenter" width="400" caption="front"\][![awesome](/uploads/2010/06/32x32.jpg "32x32")](/uploads/2010/06/32x32.jpg)\[/caption\] Take a peak at his wiring: \[caption id="attachment\_2249" align="aligncenter" width="400" caption="rear"\][![back](/uploads/2010/06/backside.jpg "backside")](/uploads/2010/06/backside.jpg)\[/caption\] How he managed to get that sucker up and running without smoking the shit out of his components is beyond me. Prost, sir. Well played.
