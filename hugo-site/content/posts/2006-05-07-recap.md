I just returned home from an epic Yukon retrieval mission...I am hoping that 46 ounces (fl.) of V8, 24 ounces (fl.) of Mountain Dew, and 32 ounces (fl.) of Xzude sports drink will relieve me of this fucking headache. ![eveljoe1.JPG](/uploads/2006/05/eveljoe1.JPG)Last night was less like this, and more like HatShop and I acting like two Down's kids. Sorry Kyle. Sorry Bob.
