What is the term? Form follows function? Not sure; I'm not a classically trained sink designer. I can tell you what I look for in [Undermount Sinks](http://mrdirectint.com/sinksandfaucets/UndermountSinks.html)... they should vaguely resemble robot eyes: \[caption id="attachment\_3908" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="robotic-looking sink looks robotic"\][![robotic sync sink sinc](/uploads/2011/10/robotic-sinc-570x482.jpg "robotic sinc")](/uploads/2011/10/robotic-sinc.jpg)\[/caption\] Amazing. Katie and I rent. We cook a lot, and intend to buy or build before too long...mix that up and it is no stretch to think that we are into sinks. Mr. Direct sinks are great, functional, and have the added bonus of being cool to boot. When we make a move, suffice to say we will have an [Undermount Sink](http://mrdirectint.com/sinksandfaucets/UndermountSinks.html) like the bad guy pictured above. Cool looking, big, and easy to clean...the price is actually lower than the boring guys from Lowe's and Home Depot as well...pretty much a done deal.
