I've wanted to play around with Adafruit's Occidental distro since it was announced. The whole gist of the release is that it better caters to the hack-y types...they have taken Wheezy and built in some utilities. Especially cool is Bonjour, which \*should\* allow ssh access from my other networked machines. Still getting to that point, but I have installed the thing for experimentation. Thus far I have been poking around...my small assistant did some stress testing... ![raspberry pie occidental distro](/uploads/2012/09/raspberry_pie.jpg "raspberry_pie") I have some battery packs in the mail, and I need to configure my WiFi dongle. The idea is to let the machine run headless, and see what I can stand up with Python. I need to play around with the pinouts a bit and come up with some ideas. I could bring Clocky back from the dead...we'll see what shakes out.
