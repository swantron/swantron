Katie's flat iron failed...TO THE RESCUE! Pull that sucker apart... ![boom](/uploads/2011/03/boom-goes-the-dynomite.jpg "boom-goes-the-dynomite") Burn mark...oh snaps...TO THE LAB! ![flat](/uploads/2011/03/flat-iron.jpg "flat-iron") Blown switch...NOW WHAT! I'm going to try to bypass the switch, as it only functions to toggle a LED. Maybe I will find a switch that will fit the board...I have enough crap laying around this joint.
