Remember this from...say...25 years ago? I first played Mario on a black and white TV in my neighbor's basement...I shit you not. Black. And. White. Here it is in color... ![dumb](/uploads/2010/05/MarioandToad.gif "MarioandToad") Well, apparently it took a while, but somebody has finally notices this gem from Toad. ![f you too](/uploads/2010/05/ToadFuckYou1.jpg "ToadFuckYou") Whatever. That may be cool, but by Super Mario 2, he was demoted back down to his worthless status. Remember his "ability?" Being able to lift things quickly? Joke is on you, dick.
