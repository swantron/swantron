Quick update on the Red Bull Creation status. \[caption id="attachment\_4889" align="alignnone" width="2956"\][![tur bull encabulation](/uploads/2013/04/turbullencabulator.jpg)](https://swantron.com/encabulation/turbullencabulator/) grnd efx 2k13\[/caption\] We're turbull encabulating... <iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/kPhq_ZLdZl4" width="560"></iframe>I'm lacking a sufficient power source to push a ton of these LEDs simultaneously, so that is that for now. Power brick and a back-up strip are in the mail, so ambition will dictate how bright we go with this. The physical stuff is largely roughed-out, so now the challenge lies in refining the UI to this thing. Well, the secondary user's interface is the thing that needs attention. My user is ready to roll. Time is running short...tune in soon. \*\*\* \*\*PROTIP\*\* ~burn the shit out of the copper contact tabs if you chop a RBG LED strip...the remnant rubber is a solder contact's worst nightmare~ \*\*\*
