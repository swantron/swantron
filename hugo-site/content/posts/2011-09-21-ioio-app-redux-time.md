I put together a simple proof of concept using a slider to control a PWM pin out...simple is an understatement. ![pwm app ioio](/uploads/2011/09/pwm-app-570x320.jpg "pwm-app") Nice, right? In doing this, I did a fresh download of the IOIO example apps, as I had gutted the Blink example for my 120V relay app. It turns out that there is a fresh firmware version...I grabbed the new IOIO library that is associated with that. So, my proof of concept doesn't function...I tested it with an LED to no avail. So, I have a few items to address before I push out another project

2. Update firmware | flash V3 to my IOIO
3. Update my IOIOPowerSwitch App to contain IOIOLib V3
4. Update READMEs / Github / Android Market to cite firmware version
5. Update proof of concept to same specifications
\_ It should go smoothly, after the first bullet-point is in the books. Stay toooned.
