I managed to hit a walk-off dinger to end the 2010 softball season. Unfortunately, my shitty co-ed league counts dongs as outs, and my walk-off was the last out of our year. Whoever penned that rule was a fun-hater. I did manage to rip my goddamn knee open, yet again... ![softball injury](/uploads/2010/08/softball-injury.jpg "softball-injury") Insult to injury, I suppose. We'll get 'em in 2011.
