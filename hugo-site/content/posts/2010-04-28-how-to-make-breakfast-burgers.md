Trying to spice things up around the breakfast table? Here is something new and interesting: breakfast burgers! Boy Howdy! \[caption id="attachment\_2061" align="aligncenter" width="739" caption="too many noms to count. there are countlessly many noms here. "\][![breakfast burger](/uploads/2010/04/breakfast-burger.jpg "breakfast-burger")](/uploads/2010/04/breakfast-burger.jpg)\[/caption\] Not only are these breakfast burgers nutricious and delicious, they are uber easy to make. Follow these easy steps. 1) Make two too many bacon turkey burgers for dinner 2) Place said bonus burgers in a Rubbermaid container (here, I went for a 1L with rounded square edges) 3) Bring to work 4) Open container 5) Eat breakfast burgers at work, in the morning \*\*\*Note: breakfast burgers are best when enjoyed with multi-vitamin and coffee\*\*\*
