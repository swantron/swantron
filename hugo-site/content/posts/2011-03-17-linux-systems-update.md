Done, done, and done. All systems go. I dropped Ubuntu 10.04 LTS on the 17" Dell, via an old image-having CD I had in the man-lab. Updated via the manager to 10.10, on my makeshift table: \[caption id="attachment\_3254" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="Laptop Stand"\][![honda-y](/uploads/2011/03/honda-computer.jpg "honda-computer")](/uploads/2011/03/honda-computer.jpg)\[/caption\] No problem what-so-ever. Works like a champ. I snagged the 10.10 image from Ubuntu, and created a bootable USB. I backed up my photos on said drive...so that sucker is one sweet USB. I have been packing it in my pocket, in case anyone needs some Linux on the fly...not holding my breath however. Anyhow, my wireless card needed some update action...had to go manual on the little guy: \[caption id="attachment\_3255" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="hiding spot"\][![w2ires](/uploads/2011/03/cabel.jpg "cabel")](/uploads/2011/03/cabel.jpg)\[/caption\] So the secret is out...I keep my modem and router in a wire-jumble behind the TV. It works. As does Meerkat on my Mini 9...with which I'm posting this tale at this moment. So, I have a Ubuntu trifecta going on right now. Seems like they should have me on the payroll or something. Free shirt, or something. Not having Windows is prize enough.
