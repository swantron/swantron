This afternoon found me once again at the local WalMart killing time whilst a team of half-assed mechanics swapped out the oil in my Yukon. I have been dropping approximately 1/2 pint of power steering fluid onto various area parking lots for a few months now...keep this in mind. Well, soon after entering the store from the auto service area, I came across this gem. Have you ever wondered how much it would cost a guy or gal to promptly indicate to his/her house guests of his amazing lack of class? ![](http://bouncerblog.com/wp-content/tree.jpg) Fifty eight bucks. Another sure shot way to indicate your udder classlessness would be to take the rug rats out to the old shopping center dressed like this...in mid-November. ![](http://bouncerblog.com/wp-content/ass.jpg) Yuck. So my story is really not that interesting. I did however play a few demo games on the Xbox 360, which was pleasant. Upon my return to the auto center check out area, the fella working the counter told me that he thinks I may have a slight fluid leak somewhere. Excellent sleuthing. Whoever made the decision to swap this guy out of housewares and into automotive deserves a promotion.
