Slashdot was bad, google is worse. Remember the whole Topeka changing its name to to Google thing... ![hahahaha](/uploads/2010/04/google-kansas.png "google-kansas") ...see? It is like that, but only more asinine. Loads of laughter. (disclaimer...google sandboxed swantron during my domain name change, rendering my PR 0...assfaces also dropped me from AdSense twice...fuck Google)
