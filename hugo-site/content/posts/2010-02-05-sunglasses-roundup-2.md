Wikipedia states (horribly) : "Sunglasses can be worn to hide one's eyes: They can make eye contact impossible, which can be intimidating to those not wearing sunglasses; the avoided eye contact can also demonstrate the wearer's detachment,\[citation needed\] which is considered desirable ("cool") in some circles." Some circles? I think all circles would consider sunglasses cool, or even bad-ass. Like the over-the-top-awesome MP3 shades that Dog the Bounty Hunter sports, regardless of location and time of day... \[caption id="attachment\_1633" align="aligncenter" width="525" caption="aggressive."\][![](/uploads/2010/02/oakley_thump_hi.jpg "oakley_thump_hi")](/uploads/2010/02/oakley_thump_hi.jpg)\[/caption\] ...calling those things cool is like calling Richard Branson's sea-plane "neat." Grossly understated. I know a lot of the swantron reader base is looking for deals. And so! Here is an opportunity to render deals somewhat moot.... check out the screaming deals on [wholesale sunglasses](http://www.cheapwholesalesunglasses.com) I dug up. The selection is pretty incredible, and the prices are honestly surprisingly low. If I could get the e-tail thing rolling, I would not hesitate for a second to start slanging these things...you name it, they have it. It is hard to think about sunglasses without thinking Blues Brothers. That movie single-handedly made the Ray-Ban Wayfarer iconic.

Hook up some stutters a la Kanye \[caption id="attachment\_1635" align="aligncenter" width="525" caption="UV protection...no thanks"\][![](/uploads/2010/02/stutter-shades.jpg "stutter-shades")](/uploads/2010/02/stutter-shades.jpg)\[/caption\] Croakies sold separately. Gigantic Croakies, hopefully not available for purchase...so bad \[caption id="attachment\_1636" align="aligncenter" width="525" caption="those could support an anvil on your damn neck"\][![](/uploads/2010/02/croakies.jpg "croakies")](/uploads/2010/02/croakies.jpg)\[/caption\] Those puppies would look slick on those MP3 shades. Black of course. Anyhow, hit the link for a look at some sweet [wholesale sunglasses](http://www.cheapwholesalesunglasses.com). Drop me a line if you start selling those suckers, because I'm always in the market for some aviators.
