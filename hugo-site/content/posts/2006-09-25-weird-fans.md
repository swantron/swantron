For some reason unbeknown yet to Grif and me, we were not able to view bouncerblog.com's stats last week. Kyle came through (as usual) and we are good to go with the primary application that we both seem to check most often. In the lapse from the seventeenth to the twenty fifth, we seem to have had four search term hits for the phrase "overall hot pants"...I will let you grab that visual and run with it.
