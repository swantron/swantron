The internets have been abuzz with talk of further stifling of Android tethering. Regardless of what will come of this, I would recommend getting a setup in place. May as well...you paid for the device. Am I right? My breaking point came with continued poor results from the wireless connection at work. Enough was enough. After trying several mean with which to tether, I think I have found one that is suitable for my needs. ![droid 2 verizon tether](/uploads/2011/05/droid2-tether.jpg "droid2-tether") My hardware is simple...mid-line Dell Studio Notebook running Ubuntu 11.04...Droid 2, rooted, running Fro-Yo. Verizon with data plan...unlimited, if that is still the case. Connection...check ![droid verizon tether](/uploads/2011/05/droid-tether.jpg "droid-tether") I played around with several apps, but have found that Barnacle Wifi Tether from the Android Market does the trick quite nicely. I have dumped several gigs through 3G, and it is decently fast. Haven't had to reboot, or do anything wonky to this point. I have had two clients connected simultaneously, and it seems to be chugging along. You must configure the security settings, as this puppy lets it rip wide open out of the box. Grab the app from the Market before Google folds to Verizon. If you need any help rooting your phone, holler at me as well.
