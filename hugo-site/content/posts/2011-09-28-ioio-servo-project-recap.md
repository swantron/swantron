So, good news and bad news in regards to my [IOIO servo controller project](https://swantron.com/ioio-servo-controller/). Good: I have published my [code to GitHub](https://github.com/swantron/IOIO-Servo-Controller). See... ![IOIO sample code](/uploads/2011/09/IOIO-Git-570x356.png "IOIO-Git") Bad: [Ytai](http://ytai-mer.blogspot.com/), the creator of IOIO itself, let me know that my code is in need of an overhaul. Big time. I am experiencing too much lag...losing a ton of time in the writing phase of my app. Expect an overhaul of said code, in preparation for my next project. I have seen some activity on both of my apps on the Android Market. I feel some moral obligation to fix both apps, cite some versions, etc. This one could take some time, but should result in a pretty sweet project. On a strange note, Ytai has a sample app that handles the analog input that I need for my next effort. I should be able to stand up a project before too long...pretty pumped. Anyhow, check that code if you are bored. Really bored. I will update when I get some decent code committed...until then...
