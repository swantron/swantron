The Cubs may not be very good at playing baseball, but goddamn it they are scrappy. <object height="350" width="425"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/qy5M3Odq588"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed height="350" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/qy5M3Odq588" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" wmode="transparent"></embed></object>The best deal of all is the near no-hitter that Big Z nearly threw. Final score, Pads 1, Cubs 0. Good.
