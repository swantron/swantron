Got a fan? An antiquated pointy skateboard? An afternoon? Neon spray paint. [![retard-board](/uploads/2009/12/retard-board.jpg "retard-board")](/uploads/2009/12/retard-board.jpg)1) pull apart the fan case...a dangerous Rad Board is a good Rad Board 2) replace fan blades with small, sharp, non-menacing looking blades 3) hook above components to the less-pointy end of a pointy skate board 4) put a propane tank looking thing on it with some tubes hooking to the non-spray painted stuff 5) spray anything neon yellow that looks boring, in order to awesome things up a bit 6) fire up the fan and tear ass around the block
