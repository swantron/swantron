Busy at work upgrading the RightNow site. Busy at home chasing our mobile baby. Not too busy to throw a thumb up... [![busy](/uploads/2012/11/busy.jpg "busy")](https://swantron.com/busy/busy/)New blog content will follow shortly. I have a RaspberryPi Cobbler kit and case on order from AdaFruit, and a Wii U reserved at GameStop. Automated garage door opener is in the planning phase for the former, and Mass Effect 3 sitting in wait for the later. Stay tuned.
