So close... ![vehicle debug](/uploads/2011/12/vehicle_debug-570x281.jpg "vehicle_debug") I hit another snag with respect to my IOIO specs butting heads with actual power yield. An early success: <iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="416" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/pkmF_sRSGos" width="570"></iframe>...followed by being unable to replicate via battery control, despite higher voltage. I might be running into a similar incident that I saw when putting together the PowerSwitch Tail project. I'll get there...might have resisters coming out the ass, but I should be able to solve this issue with a creative open-drain setup as well. Tune in again...
