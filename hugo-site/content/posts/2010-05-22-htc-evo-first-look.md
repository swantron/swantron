Is there such a thing as ‘phone envy?’ There should be. I am pretty sure I have an extreme case…maybe I could be the subject of some sort of case study. What has me this week? HTC Evo. Android 2.1 and a slick screen…need I say more? \[caption id="attachment\_2164" align="aligncenter" width="600" caption="4.3 inch screen...two cameras...kickstand...FTW!"\][![4.3 inch screen](/uploads/2010/05/htc-evo.jpg "htc-evo")](/uploads/2010/05/htc-evo.jpg)\[/caption\] This sucker is hot. Long story short, this is the answer to the 4G iPhone and to the Nexus One. I think the Apple Fanboiz would have to admit that the Evo is superior to anything coming out with an ‘i’ appended to the front. Does the iPhone have a kickstand? Didn’t think so. The Evo does. Does the iPhone have two cameras? Evo does; an 8-megapixel and a 1.3 megapixle. Count ‘em and weep, fellas. Since this phone is still under the radar, so to speak, so tracking down [HTC Evo Accessories](http://www.htcevoaccessories.net/) is definitely an online mission. Here is a link to [HTC Evo Cases](http://www.htcevoaccessories.net/cases.html)…what the heck…I’ll even throw you a bone with a [ HTC Evo Screen Protectors](http://www.htcevoaccessories.net/scprandsk.html)link. In the meantime, I’m going to be sitting here pouting that I still have a RIM phone. BlackBerries seem so 2007.
