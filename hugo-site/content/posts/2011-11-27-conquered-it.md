Oh? Zelda Twilight Princess? Conquered it. \[caption id="attachment\_4123" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="conquered it."\][![beating zelda on wii](/uploads/2011/11/beating-zelda-570x319.jpg "beating-zelda")](/uploads/2011/11/beating-zelda.jpg)\[/caption\] The hardest part of snapping this pic was avoiding eye contact with Katie, who was on the couch laughing at me. [Tradition](https://swantron.com/nerd-bucket-list/ "beating Ocarina of Time") is tradition. As I was preparing the shot, I noticed that my phone was picking up the infrared LEDs from the Wii sensor bar... \[caption id="attachment\_4124" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="infrared-y"\][![wii sensor bar infrared](/uploads/2011/11/wii-sensor-570x284.jpg "wii-sensor")](/uploads/2011/11/wii-sensor.jpg)\[/caption\] I had pegged the Wii bar as a passive unit...a la IR receivers only. I guess I was wrong, and now have an urge to rip one apart. But I digress. This game took me ages to complete...feels good to be done with this one. Not quite as fun as Ocarina, but Twilight was a good time. Rumor has it that the new Zelda for Wii is borderline unreal...look for me to post a 'conquered it' picture on this site in 2016.
