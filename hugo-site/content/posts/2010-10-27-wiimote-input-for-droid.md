Nerd cred...oh indEEd ![that sums to plus 3](/uploads/2010/10/besties.jpg "besties") Playing GBA games on a Droid is cool. Playing GBA games on a Droid via a Wiimote is ubercool. Once I can figure out the accelerometer input, I'll post more. In the meantime, I'll be playing a little Mario Pinball. Suckers.
