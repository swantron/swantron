I am now an official Android fanboi. It would be impossible to hide that fact. Granted, I have yet to root my Droid 2, but I am at least ninety something out of a possible one hundred 'big into' this OS. Pretty pumped I waited for Snapdragon...pretty pumped I feigned the urge to get a first generation device...pretty pumped that Apple and or AT&amp;T are not around my neck of the woods...you name it. I'm in a good place, cellularly. +1 use of the word 'cellularly' Regardless, I am left with the problem of what to do with all of my passé phones. +1 tilde I have a stack of Verizon phones sitting around, with very little use. Zero use, in fact, unless you can count 'looking at and laughing about how ridiculously horrid technology was two years ago' a use, which in fact I do not. Good thing I found a site that will give you [money for your mobile](http://www.sellmymobile.com/selling-mobile-phones/money-for-your-mobile/) phone. Not just a bit, either. That is, of course, unless you are still rocking the Zach Morris phone: ![slater](/uploads/2010/09/slater.jpg "slater") Damn right A.C. is going to sit backwards in his chair, Preppy. You know what is cool about SellMyMobile? Not only will they give you money for your cell, but they are saving the environment as well. My old Blackberry may not be as worth as much as the big hitters (iPhone, iPad, Nokia N8, etc.) but it will at very least stay out of a landfill. There are some toxins in that sucker...gold too, but also toxins. Hit that bump up there to see what I'm talking about. Worth a shot, especially if you have a sweet phone that you are looking to monetize. Reduce, Reuse, Monetize. I think.
