Materials, purchased. ![busy lab is busy](/uploads/2013/04/lab-busy.jpg) I'm a bit further down the road as of this posting, and already in a tool crunch. It looks like Lowe's is the winner of this round...I'll be back there tomorrow on my lunch break. "You wore that apron yesterday Lowe's bro! j/k! Throw 'er on the tab!" Anyhow, this goal for the weekend is to have the base infrastructure in a rudimentary complete status. I have a bunch of question marks at this point, but a sharpening picture of where Emma and I will end up with this thing. I need to get saws and edible stuff out of the picture, so I'm hoping to be in the hardware / software phase of this thing in a few days. The generally awesome people at Adafruit have a new Arduino heading towards the Rockies, and I have a bunch of LED strip-centric things to study before that happens...tons to do. Sensors to study...screws to drive...Fruit Loops to eat. We're busy. Need some Red Bulls. Stay tuned.
