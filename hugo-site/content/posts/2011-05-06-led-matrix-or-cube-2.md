They've arrived... \[caption id="attachment\_3469" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="nearly a gross"\][![white leds](/uploads/2011/05/white-led.jpg "white-led")](/uploads/2011/05/white-led.jpg)\[/caption\] 125 white LEDs. My first thought is 5\*5\*5 LED cube, powered by the Arduino. I am also thinking that a 6\*20 LED matrix would be pretty slick. Either way, my soldering skillz will be put to the test, and awesomeness will surely ensue.
