I would be lying to say that it wasn't disappointing to see my Silverado SS from the rear view mirror of my new Old Man F150. \[caption id="attachment\_4600" align="alignnone" width="1000"\][![old balls](/uploads/2012/06/Fordf150.jpg "Fordf150")](https://swantron.com/old-man-truck/fordf150/) NRA sticker?\[/caption\] Emma outgrew the SS about a year and a half earlier than I had anticipated. This 07 showed up on craigslist with 40k miles. Couldn't pass it up. I'm not kidding about putting some stars and stripes on the license plate. I can't picture anything else on this big white thing.
