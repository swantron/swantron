New Ubuntu is the best Ubuntu. You know what that means...Lucid Lynx is stable, and currently running on my primary machine. \[caption id="attachment\_2080" align="aligncenter" width="800" caption="a bit too cluttered to be truly lucid"\][![lucid lynx](/uploads/2010/05/ubuntu10.jpg "ubuntu10")](/uploads/2010/05/ubuntu10.jpg)\[/caption\] So far so good. Visually, Lynx is a bit more polished than Koala. Boot time was quicker...drivers working, etc. Even my Arduino front end fired up from the terminal...we are good in the hood. LTS...pretty damned stable for a beta, per se. Stay tuned...I still have Karmic on my old Dell, so perhaps I will fire them up side-by-side and write a review. Perhaps.
