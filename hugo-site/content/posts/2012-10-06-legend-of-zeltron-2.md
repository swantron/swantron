[Per](https://swantron.com/nerd-bucket-list/) [tradition](https://swantron.com/conquered-it/)... ![legend of zeltron](/uploads/2012/10/skyward_sword.jpg "skyward_sword") After a nine month parenting hiatus, I've managed to wrap up Legend of Zelda Skyward Sword. Bonus points awarded to the developer who was tasked with reddening up the final boss's hair in the final fight cut-scenes to keep it distinguished from the fire sky... ![bozo the boss](/uploads/2012/10/zelda_demise.jpg "zelda_demise") That bright red flame mullet doesn't look ridiculous. At all. I have an urge to take on Majora's Mask, but estimate that the game would take me approximately three years to beat at my current clip. Might have to wait for the WiiU Zelda title to drop, and hope Emma likes watching Zelda more than the Disney Channel.
