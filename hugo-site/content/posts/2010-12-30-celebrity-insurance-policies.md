Did you know that Mariah Carey has a ONE BILLION DOLLAR insurance policy ON HER LEGS? Sorry to do the all-caps shout thing, but that is pretty weird to me. Mimi is not alone here...there are all sorts of celebrities with huge policies on weird things. Today, we are talking insurance. Buckle up. ![insurancebot](/uploads/2010/12/insurancebot.jpg "insurancebot") Becks is out there too. David Beckham has a seventy million dollar policy on his legs and feet. Makes you wonder what exactly those soccer players are worth. Have you ever heard of America Ferrera? I sure hadn't, until I read that she has a ten million dollar policy on her teeth. I'm going to say that one is a little unnecessary. Angelina Jolie? You guessed it...insured body for one billion, cash. I don't know about the cash thing, but it sure sounded good. Better than The Boss in the 1980s. Speaking of The Boss, Springsteen has a seven million dollar policy on that raspy voice of his. How about that... Where did I read about this, you ask? I stumbled across a site with this info on it while looking for an [online insurance quote](http://www.freeinsurancequotes.org/). Not only did freeinsurancequotes have the car insurance quote I was looking for, but they had an article about the celebrity policies. They also had home insurance and life insurance info. Pretty slick...check it out. In the mean time, I'll be looking into getting my bloggin' fingers insured. What do you think they are worth? I'd bet hundreds.
