I've had time to digest E1. As much time as it takes to decipher nonsense, but time none-the-less ![](/uploads/2010/02/swantron-lost.jpg "swantron-lost") Musings / Observations: ~ No sign of my favourite Tail-y and Lost-y in general, Mr. Eko. Mista Eko ~ Likewise, no sign of Michael, Walt (WAAAAALT!), Ana Lucia, Libby, and Shannon ~ Less vodka? In the pilot, Jack scored two extra mini-bottles of vodka...Cindy doles out only one in the reset ~ Same scene as ^, Rose is comforting Jack...role reversal ~ Charlie wants to die, whereas Hugo claims to be lucky as hell ~ Locke is still wheelchair bound, yet still claims to have gone on his walk-about...how the hell did he have time for it, and still catch Oceanic 815? ~ First hour (recap) drilled straight into the 2nd hour's last-season-of-lost-answer-some-crap rapid pace ~ Smokie = Man in Black...no more wondering about that ~ Ben gets punk'd...tries to be slick after wiping out Jacob, until getting pwned and shpwn dead Locke ~ Hugo being decisive after seeing Jacob was intense, and anti-Jack ~ LeFleur is going to tear shit up...took out 4 Udders before they got him sacked and to the Temple and most importantly... ~ My main man Sayid is 'New Jacob'. Write that down...I called it. Miles was stunned and Jack failed. It is going to be awesome. Pretty excited at the pace and feel of the final season. The reset will play itself out. There will be a few long 'why Kate did what she did...Sawyer being good' episodes, granted, but it should be a quick 30+ hours.
