This is pretty awesome... ![...looks about right](/uploads/2009/09/solitare.jpg "solitare") ...playing a little solitaire...listening to a little drivel. All in all, pretty good day at work. With Obama's popularity down to 45% and this shit going down on the House floor, we might not bankrupt ourselves after all. Special shout out the Representative watching the baseball game on the left. Nice work on the MLB.com package.
