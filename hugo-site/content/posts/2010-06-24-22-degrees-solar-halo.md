I took a spin outside for a brief reading session on my lunch break yesterday. I'm glad I did, as I was treated to a little optical phenominon action...in the form of a 22 Degree Solar Halo. FTW. I'm posting some pics I snapped...I'll toss in the full write-up soon. [![dang](/uploads/2010/06/22degreehalo.jpg "22degreehalo")](/uploads/2010/06/22degreehalo.jpg)[![cool](/uploads/2010/06/22-degree-halo.jpg "22-degree-halo")](/uploads/2010/06/22-degree-halo.jpg)[![number 1](/uploads/2010/06/sun-circle.jpg "sun-circle")](/uploads/2010/06/sun-circle.jpg)[![inverted](/uploads/2010/06/optical-halo.jpg "optical-halo")](/uploads/2010/06/optical-halo.jpg)I inverted the colors of that last pic, quite obviously. That will be my template, so to speak, on which to wax nerdy in a Physics-y kind of way. Stay tuned.
