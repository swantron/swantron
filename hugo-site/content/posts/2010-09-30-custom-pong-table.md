I know of one thing more annoying than table tennis...table tennis players. Oddly aggressive, hollering, talking shit, and most bizarre...striking athletic stances? Nope. Not buying into it. Pretty sure the best thing that has ever happened to ping pong tables was the invention of beer pong. That is, until right crapping now. Take a (high end (citation needed)) table tennis table: ![killerspin](/uploads/2010/09/ping-pong.jpg "ping-pong") Knock that self righteous assface down to size with a little yellow, polka-dotted dress: ![killerdressbro](/uploads/2010/09/better-ping-pong.jpg "better-ping-pong") Much better. Enjoy your *sport,* chaps.
