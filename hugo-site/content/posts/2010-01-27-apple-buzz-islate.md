I'm not open source enough to be close minded about Apple products. They make some amazing shit. I'd drop my BlackBerry in a shake if the iPhone was out on Verizon. In a shake. The nets have been afire with rumors of the next big thing from Jobs &amp; Co. Well, it is a tablet PC, and it is reportedly awesome. Jason Calacanis (Engadget founder) has had one for two weeks to beta test, and he called it the " most amazing device ever." ![iSlate](/uploads/2010/01/apple.jpg "apple") Shit. One more thing to get. Official word is slated for 1 PM... I'll post more at that point.
