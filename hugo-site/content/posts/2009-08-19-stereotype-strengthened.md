Our horribly inept mailman (same guy who crammed my RAM upgrade under our doormat) mistook Grand Ave for 3rd. Ave and dropped off a copy of a video game magazine in our mailbox. For what it is worth, it is no Nintendo Power. The only real amusing thing was the advertisements, especially the full-page job across from the contents page... \[caption id="attachment\_950" align="aligncenter" width="546" caption="directed advertising?"\]![directed advertising?](/uploads/2009/08/pimple.JPG "pimple")\[/caption\] Seems sort of presumptuous on the advertisors behalf...
