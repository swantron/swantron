After a deal of success with the command line interface-to-Arduino project, I am in the middle of stepping it up a notch. I ended up on a few blogs due to that last effort, which indicates that I am doing something worthy of note. Hats off to me, perhaps. Well, my tool belt is what it is...if I can't do it via shell scripting, I reach next for Python. In an attempt to parse stuff that I have been 'getting' via wget, I found myself trying to do some clunky regex from the command line. Guess what...I can do that without as much heartache via Python via BeautifulSoup... \[caption id="attachment\_3528" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="so...beautiful"\][![beautiful soup](/uploads/2011/05/beautysoup.jpg "beautysoup")](/uploads/2011/05/beautysoup.jpg)\[/caption\] Thus far, I have python doing the website getting and Beautiful Soup doing the parsing of my site...basically just grabbing some info at this point that I can modify. I have my LCD driven via my trusty Arduino, and that is that. Instead of redirecting standard out to serial, I am writing to serial via python. Easy breezy. I have some sloppy sloppy code at this point, and need to add some hardware and stuffs to my prototype. Stay tuned...this could be a good one.
