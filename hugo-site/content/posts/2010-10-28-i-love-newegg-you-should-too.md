You know that part of your brain that makes you do stuff unconsciously, but slowly enough that you have to wonder if it was deliberate? Case in point... You are watching TV, and some botox-faced newscaster mentions something about a stolen wallet. Your find your hand checking the contours of your pockets, making sure that your wallet is still where it should be, by your junk. You feel yourself reaching for it, and try to take control from the brain stem...take charge...you got it. Nope. That was impulse, dog. Well, I don't rock a wallet in the traditional sense. I use a binder clip to keep my credit cards from migrating to the floor. I also have the same knee jerk reaction to computer part prices as most would have with the wallet example. Hear of a computer type product...look on Newegg. Remember that HP touchscreen tablet I was pining about a few days ago... check this out: \[caption id="attachment\_2830" align="aligncenter" width="550" caption="when did robot become a bro...nice?"\][![newegg is nice](/uploads/2010/10/newegg.jpg "newegg")](/uploads/2010/10/newegg.jpg)\[/caption\] That is 20 USD cheaper than I saw on HP's website, and that is without a [NewEgg promo code](http://www.savings.com/m-NewEgg-coupons.html). Get a promo code and we make that twenty dollar savings from the HP site looks small. Small, like my wallet, which once again, is a binder clip. Even writing about my binder clip makes me check my pocket for my binder clip. I feel for you wallet folk. Check out Newegg...it'll work itself out. If you feel really bad, check out Savings.com on the regular. The Newegg promo codes are just one of many that those guys toss out there. FWIW, I want that HP even more. Gutted with Ubuntu Unity...that's the stuff dreams are made of. Nerd dreams are dreams too...nerd dreams are dreams.
