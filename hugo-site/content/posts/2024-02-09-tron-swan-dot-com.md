Alex from Peloton likes to say something along the lines of "you don't have to get ready if you stay ready." Its pretty good advice.  
  
Along those lines I decided to put together a react app to stay fresh. I've on (gitlab) pipelines and api frameworks at work for most of the year.. time for a project.  
  
It is live on [tronswan.com](http://tronswan.com)
![](/uploads/2024/04/Screenshot_20240409-124423-461x1024.png)The goals were to:  
\- hit some APIs from react  
\- mess around and build some components  
\- implement playwright on a project  
\- write GH Actions to handle build / test / deploy  
\- POC CI/CD to DigialOcean  
  
Pretty fun project.. I'm displaying weather stuff and doing fizzbuzz via a weird component. Full CI/CD. Take a look if you're bored.
