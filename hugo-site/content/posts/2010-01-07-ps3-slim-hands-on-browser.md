Instead of doing one gigantic review, I'm going to tackle a review of my new nerd toy piecemeal...up first: the browser. ![slim, sexy, clunky](/uploads/2010/01/ps3-slim.jpg "ps3-slim")
**The good:**
:) Setup was effortless. No issues getting my wireless connection up and running. :) Speedier than Opera on my Wii. Page loads are fast...no issue with Java. :) Pandora support! Pretty much rules. Sounds great; no lag. **The bad:**
:( Screen navigation clunky. Dual analog controls are definately not ideal, but the zoom and scroll feature leaves much to be desired :( Clumbsy menu structure. Address entry is a chore. **The fugly:**
:x On-screen keyboard is a fucking joke. No excuse for this, whatsoever. :x Multiple browser window function. Audio dies when window is not in the foreground. Why? All-in-all...not a netbook replacement for the couch. Yet. This might be a more viable option with the addition of a wireless keyboard, but until the window configuration is improved, I'll have my Mini 9 on the davenport. Sony dropped the ball on the browser...seems like a little bit of market research would have made the PS3 a serious alternative to the quickly expanding netbook market. In related news...sources are reporting that a new Zelda game for Wii is on the horizon in 2010. Looks like I'm still a Wii guy.
