Bouncerblog.com is most proud to announce the reemergence of the rat-tail into societal commonplace. Note the fact that Bozeman is a college town...i.e. a hotbed of uppity poser folk. Our SubaruwithblacklabwithYakimaracktotingNalgenebottles to person ratio is off the goddamn scales. Go buy some outerwear and hike the M, Bozemanites. Anyhow... ![](http://www.bouncerblog.com/wp-content/photo_0022.jpg) ![](http://www.bouncerblog.com/wp-content/photo_0021.jpg) ![](http://www.bouncerblog.com/wp-content/photo_0023.jpg)Here's Bouncerblog.com's cofounder at Samurai Sam's yesturday afternoon next in line to a bonafide rat-tail sportin' dude. I had a laugh and a bowl of yaki soba. Do feel free to email some hairdo pics to Swanson@bouncerblog.com...keep it PG though, I was raised Catholic.
