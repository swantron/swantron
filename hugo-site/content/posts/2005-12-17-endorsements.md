bouncerblog.com would like to take the time to introduce a few fine products: Fantastico! floor cleaner and Smucker's Sugar Free Maple Syrup. Fantastico! esta buenisimo! ![](http://bouncerblog.com/wp-content/eat2.jpg)![](http://bouncerblog.com/wp-content/eat1.jpg) ![](http://bouncerblog.com/wp-content/eat3.jpg) The syrup gets my endorsement after I powered through half of a bottle of the stuff last night during my consuming of four pancakes, four bacon slices, two eggs, breakfast potatoes (??), and HatShop's French toast.
