I stumbled across something potentially amazing...cheap Chinese LED modules: [![64x64](/uploads/2013/11/led-matrix.jpg)](https://swantron.com/custom-led-matrix-project/led-matrix/)For $35USD, I now have everything I need to assemble a 64x64 LED matrix, provided I stay off the coffee long enough to knock out a billion solder joints. This should be fun, and potentially challenging. I'm guessing these were initially spec-ed out for a consumer with something pretty specific in mind, but going about this DIY is going in blind. There are no libraries to leverage, so the software will have to be written from the ground up. Time to blow the dust off of the Arduino...
