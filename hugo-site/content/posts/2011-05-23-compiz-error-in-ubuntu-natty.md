For the most part, I have had good luck with Compiz, Unity, and Ubuntu 11.04 in general. I have said it before, but worth a repost...if you do a vanilla install of Ubuntu, the first thing you should do is get the Compiz configuration tool...I'll even spell it out. 1) Open a terminal window (**Ctrl+Alt+t**) 2) Run this command: **sudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager**3) Hit **enter**...done. Nothing to it. Anyhow, I have seen the following bug a few times...so I finally snagged a screenshot: \[caption id="attachment\_3514" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="wobbly fail"\][![compiz fail](/uploads/2011/05/compiz-fail.jpg "compiz-fail")](/uploads/2011/05/compiz-fail.jpg)\[/caption\] It appears that the workspace switcher and wobbly windows have some sort of issue with one another. I don't see this when I use keyboard shortcuts, and I have been employing those nearly extensively to pop around. **Super Key+S** (Windows key / Apple key) to open the switcher...or bypassed with **Ctrl+Alt+left** or **Ctrl+Alt+up** for instance. It works slickly, once you spend some time poking around. I suppose it would be prudent for me to enter this bug into the Ubuntu QA system...I am not in the mood to search for duplicate tickets. I do that crap all day at work...enough is enough. Drop me a comment if you have seen this one in action. Or, if you have any workspace suggestions, send that over too.
