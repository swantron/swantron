I have always felt a touch of guilt in regards to the amount of coffee I throw down the colloquial hatch on a daily basis. I drink the stuff out of a pickle jar...I kid you not: \[caption id="attachment\_3499" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="baseball used for size reference"\][![coffee vs cancer](/uploads/2011/05/i-win.jpg "i-win")](/uploads/2011/05/i-win.jpg)\[/caption\] It cools quicker. Bonus. My guilt was nuked from orbit today. I saw on [/.](http://science.slashdot.org/story/11/05/18/139201/Coffee-Wards-Off-Cancer) this morning that the [Oxford Journals](http://jnci.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2011/05/17/jnci.djr151.abstract?sid=a627bd2d-b499-4220-ae7d-09fcd2b2224e) published some National Cancer Institute findings, linking extreme coffee intake with a decreased chance of getting prostate cancer. The non-science-y results are as follow:

> Conclusions: We observed a strong inverse association between coffee consumption and risk of lethal prostate cancer. The association appears to be related to non-caffeine components of coffee.

Granted, they used caffeine-free coffee for their test...so that may offset some of my apparent benefits. I am still counting this as a huge win. Especially since this was all about the prostrate...I'll tip a cup to that. Or a jar.
