I enjoy looking at an alpaca with a funny hair-do. ![alpaca31.jpg](/uploads/2006/07/alpaca31.jpg)I enjoy when Voy crawls into a small space... ![mall.jpg](/uploads/2006/07/mall.jpg)...and throws up the "M" ![mall3.jpg](/uploads/2006/07/mall3.jpg)I enjoy going to gun shows, and therein seeing ponytails of this aggressive nature. ![hairshit.jpg](/uploads/2006/07/hairshit.jpg)I still enjoy this lil' dude's mullet. ![mulet.jpg](/uploads/2006/07/mulet.jpg)I enjoy eating sandwiches that are as long as my shoulders are wide. ![sammy.jpg](/uploads/2006/07/sammy.jpg)I don't enjoy alpacas as much as the girl to the right of the pictured alpaca, however. ![alpaca.jpg](/uploads/2006/07/alpaca.jpg)
