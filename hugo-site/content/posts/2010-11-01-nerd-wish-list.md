Black Friday is right around the corner. Not to offend anyone, but going to brick and mortar stores for sales is sort of ridiculous. Getting up in the middle of the night, standing in giant lines, jockeying for position, standing in more giant lines...all for the sake of saving money on a set amount of big ticket items. The marketing is blatant...'while supplies last' is likely to mean that there will be roughly a dozen of the cheap LED LCD TVs that look so attractive on paper. You probably got up and did all of that for nothing. Take a note from my book: avoid the giant hassle and shop online. I popped over to my perennial favorite [http://www.savings.com](http://www.savings.com/answers/index.html) for a few ideas. As usual, they didn't let me down. I am a pretty simple nerd. I have to buy my components on a per-project basis, so my small ticket items are taken care of. I really only have three items on my list, and savings.com has screaming deals on two of three. Item one...Android Tablet \[caption id="attachment\_4060" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="tempting"\][![savings nerd](/uploads/2011/11/savings-nerd.png "savings-nerd")](/uploads/2011/11/savings-nerd.png)\[/caption\] For development and general coolness, I want a tab. Badly. Item two...new Android Mobile Device \[caption id="attachment\_4059" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="want"\][![vzw](/uploads/2011/11/vzw.png "vzw")](/uploads/2011/11/vzw.png)\[/caption\] Read: phone. I want a new one...also for development purposes and general coolness. Item three is the new Zelda game for Wii. I have a feeling Katie will get me that...but chances are good that she could save some loot by checking savings.com first. Anyhow...take a look and save yourself a trip.
