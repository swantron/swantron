A whole bunch of Dremel work and some hot glue... The Clocky conversion to servo motor control is mostly done. ![clocky with servos](/uploads/2012/03/clocky_with_servos.jpg "clocky_with_servos") I still need to make the servo mounts more secure, but the initial test runs look promising: <iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="413" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/VWdsG7E3zco" width="565"></iframe>Getting close. I determined that the IOIO board will not fit inside the casing, so I will have to come up with an external mount. Which will change the balance, so I might end up having to add some counterweights for balance. It should shape up, mechanically, in another garage session or two. The UI work will be another session, thereafter, but look for a finished product within the next week or so.
