Quick story...My East Main Man Josh told this fine piece of woman that B.O.B. was William Dafoe. It turns out that B.O.B. did not act in Platoon, but he did act pretty damn well in this clip of "Old Balls" in action. <object height="350" width="225"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/bVwNPunH66Y"></param><param name="wmode" value="transparent"></param><embed height="350" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/bVwNPunH66Y" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="225" wmode="transparent"></embed></object>Old Balls has history with DJ Z's roomate, and had a bit of a romp in the parking lot with my former colleague Sprinkler Sid.
