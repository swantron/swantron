Remember Pajama Jeans? I [posted about them ](swantron.com/new-societal-low-pajama-jeans/)a while back, stating that society had hit a new low, due to the sheer level of WTF of which Pajama Jeans reek. Even sexy robot lady can't make these look less than WTF. ![pj jean](/uploads/2010/11/pajama-jean.jpg "pajama-jean") Well, I can't tell you if people are still making these things. I too can't tell you if people are still buying or wearing Pajama Jeans. I can say, with 100% certainty, that people are searching the webs for these retarded things...and en masse. Check the snapshot from Google Webmaster Tools: ![no way](/uploads/2010/11/pajama-pants.jpg "pajama-pants") Un. Fricking. Believable. Well, I do get a kick out of the fact the Pajama Jeans would-be shoppers ended up here. I have a feeling they would appreciate the last post about the junk food in my desk drawer at work.
