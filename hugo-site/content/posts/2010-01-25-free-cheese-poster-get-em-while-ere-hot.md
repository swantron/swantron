[![free-99](/uploads/2010/01/free-cheese.bmp "free-cheese")](/uploads/2010/01/free-cheese.bmp)[Eat Wisconsin Cheese](http://www.eatwisconsincheese.com/cheese/requestguide.aspx) via deals.woot.com is offering an awesome free poster with the following hype: *"Do you love cheese but you're not familiar with a particular cheese variety? Do you like trying new cheeses? Refer to this handy guide for 33 popular cheese varieties from Wisconsin. Contains cheese descriptions, cheese storage guidelines, buying tips, handling and cooking guidelines and tips on serving a Wisconsin Cheese Course."*I love cheese, and am quite familiar with particular cheese varieties. Feta? Check. Brie? Check. Pepper Jack? Yep, know that shit, too. Have some in the ol' ice box right now. I'll take that poster though...it'll look great in my cubicle.
