Much like the girl has decided to keep at the in-womb thing, I have decided to keep at the Java thing. Little brat. I decided to figure out how to dump accelerometer / orientation data off of the phone, for use with the IOIO. In short, I am roughly attempting to see how the data exists in its natural state, in order to figure out how to scrub and interface with my physical components. ![android side project beta](/uploads/2012/01/Android-project-beta-570x356.jpg "Android-project-beta") So far, I have nice looking code that blasts a force close scenario. Great. Anyhow, I'm hoping my time on this effort comes to a close and the girl decides to join us. Teamwork...I'll code, she can practice her singing. </ahref>
