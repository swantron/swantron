My trusty old Aoyue digital soldering device has seen better days... \[caption id="attachment\_4805" align="alignnone" width="1000"\][![dot com](/uploads/2013/01/cork-sawdust.jpg)](https://swantron.com/variable-soldering-station/cork-sawdust/) dot com\[/caption\] I'm putting together a wine cork decoration for Katie. It turns out that a Dremel with a cutting head is the easiest way to bisect corks. It also turns out that cutting seventy corks makes a ton of cork-dust. Corks. This stuff is everywhere...my soldering area is hardest hit. I'm not sure whether the more appropriate clean-up tool is my shop vac or leaf blower. Who am I kidding...definitely going leaf blower.
