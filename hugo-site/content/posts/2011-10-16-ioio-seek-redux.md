I published my code for the [IOIOSeek](https://swantron.com/android-ioio-project-ioioseek/) project to GitHub. [Here it is](https://github.com/swantron/IOIO-Seek)Fork it, do what you will. \[caption id="attachment\_3930" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="got git "\][![git hub ioio swantron](/uploads/2011/10/ioio-seek-git-570x356.png "ioio-seek-git")](/uploads/2011/10/ioio-seek-git.png)\[/caption\] My next step is to refine the project, add some automation, and make it cooler in general. I grabbed a few thing to make that happen: \[caption id="attachment\_3929" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="3x the possibilities"\][![ioio seek solar panels extra](/uploads/2011/10/extra-solar-power-570x309.jpg "extra-solar-power")](/uploads/2011/10/extra-solar-power.jpg)\[/caption\] Second IOIO board for bootloader work...which will allow for bluetooth communications between the board and a phone. Two additional solar panels...to increase the complexity of my sensor setup. Stay tuned...things should be in the works.
