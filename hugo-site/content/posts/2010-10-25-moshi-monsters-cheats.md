Looking to adopt virtual monsters and or beasts? Well, swantron dot com has you covered, weirdo. Just kidding...I had to look these things up. Curious about [moshi monsters cheats](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlEUhPt5CtQ), first acquaint yourself with moshi monsters: ![moshi](/uploads/2010/10/moshi_monster.jpg "moshi_monster") Well, those cute little guys are associated with a site that has been billed as Facebook for kids. Moshi monsters have million upon millions of users, hence, a need for cheats. Hit that link to see a YouTube video that will help to explain what is going on. I most certainly had to look these things up, in order to author this post. Turns out there is a reason they can pay for me to do this...namely, the bank accounts of the parents of 25 million users.
