Maybe Vegas got the best of me, brain-wise. I'm struggling mightily with this pull-down switch prototype on my Arduino. I got it, after far-too-much troubleshooting. ![pull down](/uploads/2010/07/pull-down-resistor.jpg "pull-down-resistor") Maybe I need another frozen slushy drink. Or alternatively, a supplementary OML to get me through this...the end goal is to get some logic incorporated to 'read' the state of the switch, so that I don't need my finger on the sonofabitch to keep the light lit. Or lighted...getting tired here. Stay tuned. I'll get this knocked out.
