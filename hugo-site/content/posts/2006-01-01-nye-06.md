I think I can wish you all a happy new year without offending any readers, so there you go. BartenderNicole, ShirtShop and I ran our asses off last night and succeeded in providing Bozeman with a great deal of hangovers. Just a few quick pics from the night: ![](http://bouncerblog.com/wp-content/nye1.jpg)![](http://bouncerblog.com/wp-content/nye2.jpg)![](http://bouncerblog.com/wp-content/nye3.jpg)The first two show the brothers Morrison getting jiggy w/ a fine bottle of sparkling wine. *\*\*\*I think I may try to throw "jiggy" in my posts until we see it in our search key word list. And often. \*\*\**The large pic pretty much sums up my style behind the bar. I serve dudes to the point of unconsciousness and then have fun at their expense. This photo was snapped at ten p.m. Also, I stumbled across this [video clip](http://www.collegehumor.com/movies/1646406/) last week. I have neither heard nor used the term pecker head in fifteen years, but that is precisely what comes to mind. Enjoy.
