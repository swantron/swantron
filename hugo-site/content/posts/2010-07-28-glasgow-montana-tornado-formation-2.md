Weird weather week continues...mi madre just snapped these from my parents' front porch in Glasgow, Montana. ![glasgow mt](/uploads/2010/07/glasgow-tornado.jpg "glasgow-tornado") ![montana tornado](/uploads/2010/07/montana-tornado.jpg "montana-tornado") ![mt twister](/uploads/2010/07/mt-twister.jpg "mt-twister") Weather Underground has this thing at 65 MPH and 13,000 feet. Five miles out. I sure hope I don't have any follow up pics.
