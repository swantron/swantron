Hey peeps. I am trying to give you all a weekly installment of my new [Hot or Not](http://www.bouncerblog.com/hot-or-not) section. Check it out; keep in mind that I am still not comfortable with the layout. Whatever. I know that the Grifmeister and I have built a small group of loyals, and the thought of said patrons calling up bouncerblog.com to find stale content makes me sick. I love you guys. Also, I am somewhat surprised at the lack of activity regarding the past weekend's antics. I feel that some of this was due to my business and Paige's party...aka the reason for a ton of retardedness. Kyle was too inebriated to recall his Canadian cigarette box sized camera in his pocket. Dave (my boss/homie) was too jungle juice-fruit-drunk to realize that calling a guy a "fucking fagot" may result in a fat lip. In short, this guy is not too upset that he had to be tending bar before the alliterative shit hit the colloquial fan. Word to your mother Owen.
