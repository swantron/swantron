I've touched on this before, but I needed to give another shout to a true comic genius, Drew at MTTS / Toothpaste / Superpoop. Trifecta of funny...today's [Toothpaste for Dinner](http://www.toothpastefordinner.com/index.php?date=102110) is amazingly good: ![gay_robot](/uploads/2010/10/gay_robot.jpg "gay_robot") Funny, and honest. Don't believe me? Check out Reddit for a few minutes...the trolls are rampant. They have trolls trolling trolls, and ranking each other's trolling abilities. It is all very confusing. Anyhow, Buy a shirt from Drew or something. He probably has some coffee mugs too...seems like that is par for the course as far as blogger merch is concerned. And check out the archive section at [Married to the Sea](http://www.marriedtothesea.com/) while you are over there...very awesome.
