I'm either the best shopper or the worst shopper in the world. I love a deal as much as anybody, but I absolutely hate the process of mulling over purchases. Stores make me uneasy...the pressure to buy impulsively mixed with the people mixed with the smells and sounds drives me up the wall. People watching is fun, but not fun enough to shop recreationally. I am the type of dude who knows what he wants. Moreover, I know how to conduct product research. More moreover, I am pretty dang good at cross-referencing, research, and comparison in general. That aspect suits me incredibly well for online shopping...which has become my main means of purchasing goods. Yours truly, for the win. \[caption id="attachment\_2203" align="aligncenter" width="600" caption="shopping robot lady is shopping"\][![shopping robot](/uploads/2010/05/robot-shopping.jpg "robot-shopping")](/uploads/2010/05/robot-shopping.jpg)\[/caption\] Shop like swantron. I have had it with sites like deals.woot and slickdeals. Too much garbage, too little quantity. If you are truly looking for some online \[link removed\], hit the link and check out savings.com. Maybe I'm jaded, since I'm a techno-fiend. I don't think so, though. I have made zero attempt to cover up the fact that I am a Dell fanboy...savings.com has \[link removed\] that make my offers from Dell themselves look pretty lousy. Don't jump to conclusions, though...they also frequently push out Verizon deals that smoke the verizonwireless deals out of the water. Just saying. Long story short, this is exactly the type of site that makes my day, shopping-wise. I can sit back and look for deals that I have been considering, without spending any time physically looking for stuff of this nature. Aggregation in it's finest. Now, the thing that remains is figuring out how to budget more effectively...that might be where \[link removed\] comes in. Personal finance is the best finance, so it seems. I'm off to check for deals on earbuds. My Skull Candys are out of commission. One earbud is one earbud too few, when you are living ghetto fabulous in a 4x8 cubicle. Offices, for the loss.
