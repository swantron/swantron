A few months ago, I picked up a killer [leaf blower](https://swantron.com/tag/leaf-blower/ "leaf blower") on Woot. Our yard is devoid of leaves. Last week, I tried to fire it up to clean the pine needles off of our steps...no dice. The thing wouldn't fire up. I checked everything obvious...pulled the spark plug to see if it was flooded...ensured the kill switch circuit was intact...checked the fuel line for a vacuum...nothing. I came to the conclusion that the issue was with the primer bulb, as it was 'pushing' but not 'pulling' air when depressed. I was getting a bunch of pressure in the fuel tank, but no fluid was making it to the primer bulb itself. Time for leaf blower surgery. \[caption id="attachment\_4207" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="well, this blows"\][![hitachi leaf blower](/uploads/2011/12/Hitachi-leaf-blower-570x320.jpg "Hitachi-leaf-blower")](https://swantron.com/how-to-fix-a-hitachi-leaf-blower/hitachi-leaf-blower/)\[/caption\] I figured that I could take apart the air filter and figure out how to bypass the primer bulb somehow. It turns out that the filter assembly is pretty accessible. Directly behind the drop-down filter cover, there are two inviting phillips head screws... \[caption id="attachment\_4208" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="well, screw this"\][![hitachi two stroke gas blower repair](/uploads/2011/12/hitachi-two-stroke-570x320.jpg "hitachi-two-stroke")](https://swantron.com/how-to-fix-a-hitachi-leaf-blower/hitachi-two-stroke/)\[/caption\] I backed said screws out enough to see a disconnected tube staring right at me. Sure enough, it was the rubber tube that feeds the primer bulb. See below----v \[caption id="attachment\_4209" align="aligncenter" width="570" caption="well, this is hosed"\][![hitachi fuel line disconnected leaf blower](/uploads/2011/12/hitachi-fuel-line-570x320.jpg "hitachi-fuel-line")](https://swantron.com/how-to-fix-a-hitachi-leaf-blower/hitachi-fuel-line/)\[/caption\] It looks like the engineers at Hitachi sunk a spring in the end of the hose to avoid kinks, and relied upon friction to keep the hose in place. It looks like a design flaw, as the two-stroke's vibrations had the thing rattled loose in much less than an hour's worth of operation time. Quick fix though...the unit fired up immediately upon reconnect and priming. Back in business. It might get old pulling the filter assembly off if this hose becomes a nagging issue. On the plus side, this thing was a steal and is crazy overpowered. I hate to say that I would still recommend this even with the flaw...it really does blow.
