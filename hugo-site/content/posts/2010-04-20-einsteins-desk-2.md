My pretend homeboy GW tossed up a post over at geekologie\[dot\]com with a pic of my favorite Albert's desk when he croaked. ![SWANTRON = MC^2 = E](/uploads/2010/04/einstein-desk.jpg "einstein-desk") Not too sure what that dark-looking whiteboard is all about. Or, what those odd-looking paper-like laptops are all about. Must be some sort of sick-ass supercomputer laptops, of sorts. Proast. For real. Read some special relativity...incredible. Very approachable, to boot. Einstein, FTW.
