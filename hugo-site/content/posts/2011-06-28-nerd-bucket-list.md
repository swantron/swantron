I guess I had better find a new bucket list entry... ![ocarina of time 3D](/uploads/2011/06/ocarina3d.jpg "ocarina3d") I was so excited upon beating Ocarina of Time, I snapped a self portrait with the end-screen... ![beating ocarina of time](/uploads/2011/06/swanson-joe.jpg "swanson-joe") ...and, I am in my 30s. Wow. Now what? My nerd bucket list needs a new entry. Maybe I should finish my LED cube project. Maybe I should finish my command line Twitter work. Maybe I should take on Ocarina of Time 3D... Probably not the last one...not pumped about the 3DS. Something great will ensue.
