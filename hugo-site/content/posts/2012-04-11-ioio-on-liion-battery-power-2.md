I finally bucked up and picked up a few Li-Ion batteries for my dust-collecting Clocky mod project. A two cell, a three cell, and a suitable charger for the two arrived in the mail yesterday. I've said it before and I'll say it again...lithium ion battery tech is crazy. I can't believe how deprived we were, or more accurately, how pumped I am to utilize this stuff at a decent price point. Anyhow, I managed to spec out a high quality, thrifty Li-Ion that will fit on my payload... ![ioio external liion battery power](/uploads/2012/04/ioio-external-power.jpg "ioio-external-power") ...and, the little sucker screams... <iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="413" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/25BTOgGMtWg" width="565"></iframe>I have a hard connection from my phone to the IOIO in the vid. I need to configure the new ROM with bluetooth, and wanted to test the power function stand-alone. That will be the next step. The next next step will include piecing the payload together as a drivable unit. The next next next step will be tweaking the UI for some more realistic control units. After that is next next next next, and will involve a video of the unit in action.
