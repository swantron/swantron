Big news. Team swan tron made the cut for the 2013 [Red Bull Creation competition](http://creation.redbullusa.com/). Sweet and I made an unboxing video to signal the official start of awesome junk... <iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/umObXXhYBgI?feature=player_detailpage" width="640"></iframe>--kit guts-- \[caption id="attachment\_4870" align="alignnone" width="3128"\][![wangs](/uploads/2013/04/turbull-encabulator.jpg)](https://swantron.com/turbull-encabulator-unboxing/turbull-encabulator/) ...\[/caption\] As the video demonstrates, the mood in global HQ is babblingly excited. Grabby and frantic, but excited. The competition in these sorts of things is typically a lot tougher than the balsa bento box this kit shipped in. Maybe Emma and I can pull out an upset.
