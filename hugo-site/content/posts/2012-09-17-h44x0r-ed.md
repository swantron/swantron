It looks like the script kiddies are back in class. I'd recommend taking a look at <http://www.college-paper.org/>, in order to figure out how to better "zero day" a site ![zero day attack](/uploads/2012/09/zero_day.png "zero_day") The infiltration consisted of two scripts placed onto my index.php.
