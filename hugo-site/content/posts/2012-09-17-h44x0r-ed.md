It looks like the script kiddies are back in class. I'd recommend taking a look at <http://www.college-paper.org/>, in order to figure out how to better "zero day" a site \[caption id="attachment\_4733" align="alignnone" width="927"\][![zero day attack](/uploads/2012/09/zero_day.png "zero_day")](https://swantron.com/h44x0r-ed/zero_day/) w00ps\[/caption\] The infiltration consisted of two scripts placed onto my index.php. Named...you may have guessed...\[some stuff\]zero-day\[some more stuff\] Well played.
