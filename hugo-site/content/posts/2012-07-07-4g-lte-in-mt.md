4G device-having Bozeman residents awoke to a nice surprise today...Verizon flipped the LTE switch a few months earlier than anticipated. ![LTE](/uploads/2012/07/4g-samsung1.jpg "4g-samsung") They must be calibrating the network, as my speed tests are all over the board. I have one run that was 14M down / 4M up, but several that sit in the 3G range. Either way, exciting stuff and incredible timing.
